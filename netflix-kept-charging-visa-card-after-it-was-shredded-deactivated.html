They can do that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @freshcoralblast</span></figure><p>He continued, "Now maybe I'm just late to the pitch, maybe everyone knew this and I'm the f***ing idiot but I figured this out because I was on customer service for like an hour just back and forth between my bank and Netflix because my account was charged with a card that I had shredded, deactivated, and un-linked from my bank account over four months ago."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @freshcoralblast</span></figure><p>Folks said that in order for the service to stop he needs to manually go into his profile settings and manually cancel his subscription. For good measure to ensure that his account never gets accidentally charged if he were to log into his account or someone else has access to his password and username, folks recommended he remove his account from Netflix as well.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @freshcoralblast</span></figure><p>If you're canceling your Netflix subscription on a computer, navigate to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix.com</a> on your web browser and log in.
