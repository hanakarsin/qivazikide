But we have a feeling that friendship is over now. Jordyn has found herself at the center of a Tristan Thompson cheating scandal â€” this time causing KhloÃ© Kardashian to separate from her baby's father for good â€” and it's looking more and more certain the rumors are true.</p><p>And since just about everyone has an opinion about the Kardashians and their crew â€” even people who profess not to care â€” a ton of hilarious and downright savage Jordyn Woods memes are flooding Instagram and Twitter right now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. RIP</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>At the very least, both their careers are over. But honestly, even though Karl Lagerfeld has died (RIP), his name and brand will live on forever, whereas Jordyn seems likely to become a footnote in the Kardashian family history.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Me and everyone I know when this news broke.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>News moves pretty fast these days. If you don't stop to pass your phone or tablet around, your friends might miss it. As soon as this story hit, we were all scrambling to see if it was true.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Time to call Consumer Cellular.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>We have a feeling life is about to get pretty rough for Jordyn, who has reportedly been "cut off" by the entire family, and that seems to include her billionaire bestie. Though initially Kylie was said to have been in denial about the betrayal, reports indicate she's gotten some corroboration that calls into question the future of their friendship.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Ouch.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Obviously this news is pretty fresh, given the fact KhloÃ© was complimenting Jordyn on IG earlier this week. This isn't a meme, per se, but that comment under KhloÃ©'s is pretty lethal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Don't get your honey where you get your money.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Officially, Jordyn's career is as a model and aspiring singer (I think?), but let's be real: her full time job, up to yesterday, was being Kylie's bestie. And I think that ship has sailed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Here's hoping she has some savings.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Look, I don't wish homelessness on anyone, no matter how disloyal, so here's hoping Jordyn has a good accountant and a backup plan for this next stage of her life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Fire(d) Sale!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If only this were real. As of now, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KYLIE X JORDYN</a> collection is still up and at regular price. They're sure to become collectors' items, so get yours now!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Fake news vs. strong facts.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>After the breakup news broke, Tristan tweeted and deleted "fake news' in response, but more reliable sources from the Kardashian Kamp say otherwise. KhloÃ©'s forever BFF Malika commented on a post by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@hollywoodunlocked</a>, as did Larsa Pippen. These ladies close ranks quickly!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Don't mess with Kris.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Kris has been tight-lipped about this whole affair so far â€” let's be real, she's definitely looking at a way to maximize her 10 percent from the fallout of this scandal â€” but I'm sure she's 100 percent handling this Olivia Pope-style.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. What would that resume look like?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Any career counselors in the house? What is the next step after a professional setback like this?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. She doesn't even go here!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If Jordyn's phone has been cut off, that's probably a good thing. New phone, new town, new identity. It's the only way to start over.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Is it karma?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Didnâ€™t Khloe steal Tristan from a woman named Jordyn? ðŸ‘€ If this ainâ€™t losing him how you got him, then idk what is! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XcIRWAx7DN</a></p>â€” Carla D. (@completelycarla) <a href=#>February 19, 2019</a></figure><p>It's alleged that Tristan was still with a woman named Jordan (different spelling) when he and KhloÃ© started dating. In fact, Jordan Craig is mother to his first child, Prince Oliver. They say once a cheater always a cheater, but dang if this isn't some weird symmetry.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Poor KhloÃ©.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Look, if KhloÃ© knew Tristan was with someone else when they got together, you might see this as karma and you might be experiencing some type of schadenfreude over that. I'm not gonna judge you. But I can't help it â€” I feel bad for her.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. This meme truly works for all situations.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>OK, at this point I'm starting to feel more than a little bad. From the reports out there, it sounds like Jordyn made out with Tristan at a house party, which is definitely not cool. But let's not forget who the true dog in this situation is.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. #JordynWoodsIsOverParty is trending.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>jordyn woods after she hears kylies car pull up <a href=#>#JordynWoodsIsOverParty</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JTjFXX2lk8</a></p>â€” lil samich (@avotatomaddie) <a href=#>February 20, 2019</a></figure><p>Twitter is so predictable. It didn't take long for this bandwagon to get going. While I am 100 percent in agreement that Jordyn was a bad friend here, I'm more interested in attending the #TristanThompsonIsCanceledParty.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yzsNinZLCnn5nAbrnEppys</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
