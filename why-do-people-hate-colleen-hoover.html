Why do people hate Colleen? Let's unpack it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@colleenhoover</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why do people hate Colleen Hoover?</h2><p>For starters, a lot of readers have taken issue with the content of some of her books, particularly It Ends With Us. The romance novel depicts a violent and abusive relationship, which Colleen has previously said mirrored the one she witnessed between her parents. Given that this novel has been advertised in the romance genre, she's been accused of romanticizing toxic and harmful relationships.</p><p>Obviously, Colleen isnâ€™t the only one accused of this; many have found the Fifty Shades trilogy to do the same thing.</p><p>Following the success of It Ends With Us, the author also did various spinoff products, including a nail polish collaboration and a <a href=#>coloring book</a>. Given the novel's sensitive subjects, this was seen as incredibly insensitive by many, resulting in some pretty significant backlash. Though the coloring book was pulled, it still soured her public image for many.</p><p>With It Ends With Us later being adapted into a film, directed by Justin Baldoni and starring <a href=#>Blake Lively</a> and <a href=#>Brandon Sklenar</a>, Colleen's continued success with this controversial novel has sparked mixed reactions. Some have taken to platforms like TikTok to express their disdain for the author and highlight the controversies surrounding her, urging others to avoid supporting her work. However, as mentioned, there are also plenty of others who are here for it!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lindyslibrary href=#>@lindyslibrary</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @literaryiqra <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> in response to the people who are worried about booktok taking colleen hoover down or somehow ruining her career because some people have changed their mind like i think sheâ€™ll be really and truly fine <a title=booktok href=#>#booktok</a> <a title=booktoker href=#>#booktoker</a> <a title=colleenhoover href=#>#colleenhoover</a> <a title=coho href=#>#coho</a> colleen hoover slander colleen hoover controversy colleen hoover books colleen hoover bad writing colleen hoover problematic cancelled overrated coho books coho slander</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - lindy | booktok ðŸ“šðŸ’•" href=#>â™¬ original sound - lindy | booktok ðŸ“šðŸ’•</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Colleen Hoover has also faced backlash over harassment allegations lodged against her son.</h2><p>In addition to this, there have also been sexual harassment allegations again her son. <a href=#>Colleen's son, Levi</a>, was accused of asking a minor to send him inappropriate photos when he was in his 20s, and the user then claimed that Colleen blocked her after she tried to address it with the mother. Though Colleen has refuted these allegations, claiming she immediately addressed the claims with her son as soon as she heard about them, this combination of controversies has made her an author many hate.</p><p>With a better understanding of why people have a strong dislike for Colleen, you might wonder why they continue to read her books. Perhaps <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this Redditor</a> has a point: "I have never read her books, but Iâ€™m going to guess itâ€™s for the same reason I watched Riverdale for like four seasons. Sometimes, the things we dislike are the most entertaining."</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this Redditor</a> also made a valid observation: "Popular books always get a certain amount of people who love them and a certain amount who hate them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZKmdn6W5pnnHmqueZZOkua2xxKdkoaefq7Kz</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
