The talk shop also had in attendance the Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa;&nbsp; Hon. Uche Onyeagocha, Northern Elders Forum spokesman, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed and Prof. Usman Yusuf.</p><p>“The man ruling us now made the trust deficit among the several ethnic groups in Nigeria made it worst. What is bad is bad. I had campaigned for Buhari in 2007 when he promised to ensure the restructuring of Nigeria.</p><p>“Even Tinubu foolishly had an agreement with Buhari ahead of the 2015 presidential election to ensure the restructuring of Nigeria if elected. Buhari has been ruling us with impunity. How can we trust such a man? Even members of his cabinet don’t trust him.</p><p>“To rebuild trust in Nigeria, we have to pray to God to convince Buhari to support restructuring,” he said, regretting that “Buhari did not negotiate with us calling for restructuring but is negotiating with bandits”.</p><p>He stated that the actions and inactions of Buhari are unwittingly maligning his ethnic group, and wondered why people from his ethnic group are not calling the President to order.</p><p>The elder statesman, who said he has been in the struggle for a better Nigeria for over 70 years, pointed out that the herdsmen menace is not a new phenomenon but came to a climax under the current dispensation of President Buhari</p><p>“If Buhari does not know what restructuring is about, he should go and read the Independence constitution adopted by the Saudana, Obafemi Awolowo and Nnamdi Azikiwe. &nbsp;The 1960 Constitution made Nigeria so peaceful. The regions had autonomy and even had embassies abroad”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FuZputmJa%2FqnnIrGSnoZeav6qt0malrqWSmr9uu82eZJ6mlaLGbrzAZpidnZKWu6u7jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
