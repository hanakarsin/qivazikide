Gideon Para-Mallam, has distanced himself from the inclusion of his name in the Presidential Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</h2><p>Para-Mallam was reacting to a report done by <strong>Naija News</strong> that&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>eight CAN members</a></strong> who are opposed to the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the ruling party were named as members of the APC campaign council.</p><p>Following the development, the inclusion of the CAN officials in the Bola Tinubu campaign team had generated a lot of controversies and remained the topic of discussion on several forums.</p><p>But in a statement on Friday, Para-Mallam said his name and that of his wife were smuggled into the list, adding that&nbsp;their consent was not sought before the inclusion in the&nbsp;council.</p><p>The social justice peace advocate added that neither he nor his wife, Prof. Funmi Para-Mallam was aware of their nomination as members of the Tinubu campaign team, stressing that he is not a card-carrying member of any political party.</p><p>He said, “My attention has been drawn to a list in circulation which indicates that I (or my wife – Prof. (Funmi) Para-Mallam) have been nominated to serve in the APC’s Presidential Campaign Council. Neither of us is aware of this nomination and our consent was not sorted.</p><p>“Nigeria is a great country; our present setbacks notwithstanding. But I believe that Nigeria will be great again. I love this country. I am not a partisan politician. I am a clergyman and a social justice peace advocate. I am non-partisan. I am also not a card-carrying member of any political party in Nigeria today (not that it would be wrong, but I am not at moment).”</p><p>Para-Mallam also said CAN had taken a position against the Muslim-Muslim ticket adopted by the APC, saying that he respects the decision of the Christian body.</p><p>He added: “Besides, CAN has taken a position against any Muslim-Muslim ticket and any Christian-Christian ticket. I respect that decision. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious country. This contextual reality needs to show in the way our political parties play their politics through fair internal party politics.</p><p>“Accepting to serve in the APC’s Presidential Campaign Council will negate this fundamental reality of what we are as a multi-religious country. Politics of inclusiveness should override politics of exclusion not just in 2023 but beyond.</p><p>“I, therefore, wish to distance myself from membership of any campaign team of any political party in the forthcoming 2023 elections. I have some respected and close friends in all the major political parties. I will continue to work to promote political harmony and peaceful co-existence in Nigeria. May God give Nigeria peaceful 2023 elections.</p><p>“God bless Nigeria and guide both the parties and Nigerians as the campaign season commences.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FqZpyZnmK6prnBnqlmq6Carqy%2FjKilZqGemLm2v8iopWahnmKusa%2BMqameq5mZsq%2FAyJqjZpuRor2itcanZJynpaOwqriO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
