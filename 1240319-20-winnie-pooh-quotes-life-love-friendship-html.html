And all you can do is to go where they can find you.”</li><li>“Just because an animal is large, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t want kindness; however big Tigger seems to be, remember that he wants as much kindness as Roo.”</li><li>“Well," said Pooh, "what I like best," and then he had to stop and think. Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called.”</li></ul><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 25 best Alice in Wonderland quotes</p><ul><li>“It is always useful to know where a friend-and-relation is, whether you want him or whether you don't.”</li><li>“Promise me you’ll always remember: You’re braver than you believe and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.”</li><li>“Sometimes, if you stand on the bottom rail of a bridge and lean over to watch the river slipping slowly away beneath you, you will suddenly know everything there is to be known.”</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3d1a2f722ff4b1ac.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Uplifting betrayal quotes to help you get through the tough times</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/034f455a731ae4c2.png><ul><li>“People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.”</li><li>”Spelling isn’t everything.
