Although, that was after we paid ransom.”</p><p>Narrating his ordeal, the monarch said he had gone to visit an old classmate when the kidnappers forcefully abducted him at the front of his house to an unknown destination.</p><p>He said, “I came back home to celebrate Christmas and New Year with my people in Obi-Orodo. Then, on January 6, I decided to visit one of my old boys and senior students of Emmanuel College Secondary School in those days.</p><p>“But when I was coming back after visiting my friend around 8:30 pm, I met able-bodied men in front of my palace gate who came in their vehicle.</p><p>“They double-crossed me and forced me into their vehicle. My cousin’s brother smartly introduced himself as my driver and they set him free. They now blindfolded me and zoomed off to an unknown destination.</p><p>“I was first kept in an uncompleted building before I was transferred to another location. Within the twelve days I spent in their den, I saw hell.</p><p>“It looked so much as if they had some scores to settle with the traditional rulers and politicians, but luckily for me, their leader came out and ordered them not to torture me, that I am a decent man.</p><p>“Negotiations began between my people and the kidnappers which eventually resulted in setting me free after we paid the first and second ransom.</p><p>“They later took me and another victim to Eziama Obiato, a community in Mbaitoli LGA, along Owerri-Onitsha expressway, at night after I spent twelve days in their dungeon.</p><p>“And from there I found my way back to Owerri at Asumpta Cathedral roundabout where my people came and conveyed me back to my palace.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FvZqmnnJ6wpnnNnq2eql2luaLFxJ1kmqapYr%2BwuMRmq6hloprApMHEZqSeZZanvK55yqKbp5mgpbKzv4yipKhlnaS7or7CoWSsqJWWuLR5wJ%2Brnqpdnba0edGeo56Zo5p8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
