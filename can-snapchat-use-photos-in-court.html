For folks who love secure communications and a standalone desktop client that doesn't require their phone to have a data connection to receive messages, Signal's a pretty powerful app.</p><p>And if you're in the business of disappearing messages, although other applications now offer this feature, <a href=#>Snapchat</a>'s pretty much the king.</p><p>Some folks use Snap for some clandestine communications so naturally, people want to know: can the photos one takes on Snapchat be used in court?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can Snapchat photos be used in court? Absolutely.</h2><p>Here's a word of advice: if you're planning on doing anything illegal, then don't text about it. Don't picture message about it. Don't FaceTime about it. Don't use any application that doesn't have end-to-end encryption either.</p><p>While Snapchat does indeed have end-to-end encryption for the photos that are sent between its users, texts, and other types of messages sent through the platform don't enjoy the same kind of protection.</p><p>Snapchat indicates that they will comply with law enforcement when it comes to certain legal matters, which may include handing over any correspondence between two people.</p><p>Let's say you're using Snapchat to move some bricks and the person you were sending the disappearing messages to is a rat, or police catch wind of the fact that you're using Snap to conduct your illegal business.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Or let's say you're a really famous comedian who went from being kinda weird and dopey to getting in great shape and getting a role in a huge Netflix movie.
