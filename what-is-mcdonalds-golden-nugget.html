Now, <a href=#>McDonald's</a> has brought back an old campaign for the first time in 25 years so that adults can relive the feeling of seeing which toy they got with their meal.</p><p>McDonald's has reintroduced six collectible McNugget buddies, and they'll now be available in the new Kerwin Frost Box that was launched by the chain on Dec. 11, 2023. The McNugget buddies are all themed around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerwin Frost</a>, but there's also a secret seventh buddy that's almost impossible to find.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the McDonald's golden nugget?</h2><p>In addition to the six collectible McNugget buddies that come with the box, there's also a seventh "Golden Legend" buddy that's extremely rare. This buddy has a face and is entirely gold, but is otherwise not based around the talk show host the way that the other six are.</p><p>The buddy comes with a card that says “Golden like the arches, golden like the fries, golden like the edges on McDonald’s apple pie.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It isn't clear how many of these "Golden Legend" buddies there are or how rare they might be, in large part because McDonald's has yet to acknowledge that they even exist. It seems possible, then, that this "Golden Legend" buddy is part of some second phase of the campaign. For now, a few McDonald's have gotten confused after receiving the buddy when he didn't even seem to be one of the options.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Kerwin Frost collaboration is easy to get yourself.</h2><p>If you're curious about the "Golden Legend" nugget or about any of the other buddies you can buy, getting one of the Kerwin Frost boxes is actually pretty easy, and they should be available at most McDonald's locations.</p><p>The boxes come with a 10-piece Chicken McNugget or a Big Mac, along with fries and a drink, as well as one of seven options for a buddy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“Complete with mix-and-match outfits, the Buddies’ designs are inspired by Kerwin’s childhood experiences and belief that everyone should feel free to express themselves,” McDonald's explained of the campaign.</p><p>In addition to the "Golden Legend," there are six other McNugget buddies to collect, and all of them have different designs and even unique names.</p><p>There's Kerwin Frost, Don Bernice, Uptown Moe, Waffutu, BRRRICK, and Darla. You might think that any one of these is the best, but don't be disappointed if you get one of them instead of the "Golden Legend." We may not know exactly how rare it is to find one of them, but we do know that it isn't easy to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmalk5m8r63Lnapmn5%2Bhsaa6jKesoJ%2BVqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
