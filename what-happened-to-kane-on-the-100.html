A recent episode, "The Old Man and the Anomaly" featured some hairy moments for a lot of characters in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>One hero was swallowed by an anomaly, some got banged up pretty badly... to the point where it seems like they won't survive, and others are in all sorts of danger. So what's going to happen to them?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what happened to Kane on The 100?</h2><p>Due to the nature of the show, there are a lot of far-out things that happen pretty much every episode, and what Kane just went through is no different.</p><p>WARNING: there are MASSIVE spoilers ahead.</p><p>So "The Old Man and the Anomaly" featured Kane being no more... well, not exactly. Kane was actually detached from his body in the show and had himself put inside of ANOTHER body.</p><p>Naturally, the Chancellor isn't going to be too happy about his fate, but what's going to happen to him and his body as the show progresses? While we can't know for sure, there are some clues that will help us guess which direction the showrunners will take The 100's narrative.</p><p>What's interesting is that Kane's body doesn't look like it's in too bad of shape. Even though he's "dead" in a way, his corpse looked rather intact.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rewatching the first season of the 100, Kane just said ‚Äúsalvation comes at a price‚Äù... I am now convinced they‚Äôre going to make Clarke or Bellamy, or both, sacrifice themselves for their people in the series finale and I am not okay with it. <a href=#>#the100</a></p>‚Äî Jenna Scruse (@JenniePscruse) <a href=#>August 13, 2019</a></figure><p>As he laid beside it, I'd bet that more than a few viewers thought there'd be a possibility he'd return to his original body. Remember the tree sap that healed Diyoza? Why can't those same magical properties be used to get Kane up and running in his own corporeal frame?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Henry Ian Cusick be returning to The 100?</h2><p>The way the show's written as of now, it seems like the writers have left his fate pretty open.</p><p>The Passage won't be getting another season, so Henry could definitely return to The 100 and if the show wants him back, I'm thinking "healing" his body will be the way to do it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Kane and Abby going to break up?</h2><p>That's the big question heading into the rest of the season. Now Kane might be in a different frame entirely, but it's still the same guy operating his thoughts and decisions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>1. Marcus Kane (The 100) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uTH7EM1I7d</a></p>‚Äî Shannon O'Brien üåø #KabbyDeservedBetter (@KanesLight) <a href=#>August 8, 2019</a></figure><p>Kane is still the same morally stringent individual, and he probably isn't going to like the fact that Abby killed someone just to save him. Abby went and completely deleted someone else's mind ‚Äî Gavin's. Even though Gavin was a willing participant, I don't think that Kane is going to be happy about the outcome.</p><p>This puts Kane in an interesting position, especially when it comes to his relationship with Gabriel.</p><p>Kane and Gabe are both two men who have been resurrected by people who loved them and couldn't stand to see them perish. Kane may be angry at Abby for her willingness to sacrifice someone else but Gabriel might change his outlook on that. Maybe on their way down to the Sanctum they can have a heart to heart?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>so the 100 killed kane and abby in the same season <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9CzXwgVwYE</a></p>‚Äî c (@adoringmoore) <a href=#>August 7, 2019</a></figure><p>Prior to this episode, people thought that Kane would eventually end up in Russell's body, which would be super convenient for the show's plot. Russell has inhabited his host's body for a very long time, and now that he's no longer a leader, and if Simone and Josephine really are dead, then that means Marcus could easily slip into Russell's physical vessel. And that would play nice with Kane's sense of morality as well.</p><p>But there could be another twist ‚Äî Gavin might be totally faking Kane's takeover. He knows enough about Abby to fake a nicey-nice relationship, and if this is the case, then that means Kane's consciousness is totally gone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Szn3 ep13 of <a href=#>@The100writers</a>, if Kane dies so does this love for the 100 too!!! üò≠ü•∫‚òπÔ∏è</p>‚Äî ana (@oxx_fonseca) <a href=#>August 15, 2019</a></figure><p>So which direction will the show take? We'll just have to see and find out.
