Fayemi wants to be President if the office is zoned to the South”, a source told Daily Post.</p><p>“If he fails, he may get the SGF (Secretary to the Government of the Federation) position as long as the next President or Vice are not from South-West.</p><p>“Tinubu is monitoring all that’s happening and he seems to have pitched his tent with the SDP. The truth is that civil servants like Oni are ready to vote for him.</p><p>“With his cold war with Fayemi and Oni’s popularity, Tinubu has developed a soft spot for the SDP. And this isn’t just about Ekiti election, he may contest on the platform if APC denies him a ticket.”</p><p>It was&nbsp;gathered that Oni’s running mate, Otunba Ladi Owolabi was picked after consultations with Tinubu’s camp. Oni, 67, is from Ifaki while Owolabi, 68, is an Ado Ekiti indigene.</p><p>Sources also accused the Fayemi administration of allegedly stopping Tinubu from using the Adetiloye Hall during his visit to Ekiti monarchs a fortnight ago.</p><p>“The authorities stopped the use of the venue because Fayemi isn’t working for his political leader’s ambition. In fact, by the time Tinubu landed, Fayemi left the state via helicopter.</p><p>“They said he had to be in Abuja. He could have briefly showed up at the parley with the Obas but didn’t want to be seen with Tinubu in such a gathering”, another source told Daily Post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5ByZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm7Dx7Jkm6eclnq1tc2uma5lnZbGbrDUpqdmmaCYeqe70Waqnahf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
