As such, Mark Wiens ethnicity is mixed. His parents were missionaries, and that meant that he moved around a lot as a child.</p><h2>Education</h2><p class=align-left>Mark attended the first year of school in the tiny town of Albertville, France. He was then home-schooled for three years in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p class=align-left>He then attended an international Christian school (Rosslyn Academy) in Nairobi, Kenya, after his family moved to the East African country in 1996.</p><p class=align-left>From 5th grade, all the way up through graduating from high school in 2008 (with the exception of 1 year back in the US), he attended Rosslyn Academy.</p><p class=align-left>He did eventually return to the Valley, taking classes at Glendale Community College for a year before transferring to Arizona State University, where he graduated in 2008 with a bachelor's degree in Global Studies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4b6ab3628019e8eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kevin Mimms (Miles) biography: age, height, parents, wife, salary</span></p></a><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Mark's fascination with food was always there since he was young. When Mark's family lived in Congo, he would go into the jungle and try out wild fruits, berries, and even insects.</p><p class=align-left>When he moved to Kenya, Mark enrolled in an international school, and it gave him more opportunities to try out food from different parts of the world.</p><p class=align-left>During Mark's university years, his hunger to learn more about the world and eat more delicious food grew.</p><p class=align-left>In 2008, right after graduating, he set off to travel through South America on a solo trip with few plans. He ended up taking a TESOL certificate course to teach English. A few months later, he returned to the US to attend his sister's wedding.</p><p class=align-left>It was during that time, back in early 2009, when he decided to start a blog. With the help of about 10 cups of coffee per day, <i>Migrationology.com </i>was born.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Migrationology is a website where “people who love to eat and travel” come to experience and get a flavour of delicious food across the world from different cultures.
