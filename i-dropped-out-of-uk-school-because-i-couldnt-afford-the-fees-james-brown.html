I swear, it was our set. Oh, They were dragging Bob for not doing masters.”</p><p>In response, James, in a video shared on Instagram, confirmed he had dropped out of school over the high tuition fee.</p><p>According to the social media influencer, he was unaware of the cost of school fees and nobody told him about it.</p><p>He said, “Una dey craze? Do I look like 2face bastard you worship? Neither do I do fake life. My ID card is here, people saying why are you not school, because school fees is expensive. E dey choke me. When I went to London, I didn’t even have the idea that school fees would be too expensive.</p><p>“Nobody told me, I spent nothing less than twelve thousand nine hundred pounds just for a year when I calculated it, it was running into millions and I said it is better I go use the money buy house for village or buy house for lagos.</p><p>“That’s why I came back and did everything I did. Now for school fees money, it is not easy to go to school in London.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BqZqJllKe8sbzEnWSoraRivKd51KRkrJuYpLytecGempqto5p6qnnCqKylnJ6peqKyxaipnWWknbJussSeqmaikaKytHnBq6awpl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
