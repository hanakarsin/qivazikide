Danladi Baido, the governorship candidate of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>SDP</a></strong> debunked the rumour on behalf of the party during the official unveiling of the Party’s governorship running mate in Jalingo.</p><p>He expressed that the SDP was confident of winning the 2023 governorship election in Taraba and was not willing in any way to merge with the APC.</p><p>According to Baido, the speculation was a cheap blackmail against his person and the SDP in Taraba to discourage supporters from their good plans for the SDP.</p><p>“I am a politician of repute, I will not sell my mandate to anybody. The SDP has no plan to merge with the APC for the 2023 election.</p><p>“The speculation is just a cheap blackmail to discourage our supporters. We are aware that both the APC and PDP are afraid of us and that is why they both picked their running mates from the northern zone where I am from.</p><p>“Their choices of running mate from my zone and cheap speculations can not distract us. My local government had been privileged to produce a deputy governor and now we are not after deputy governorship but for the governorship.</p><p>“I hereby call on all our supporters to remain resolute and disregard all speculations making the round by the PDP and APC against the bright future of SDP in Taraba”. Hon. Baido denied.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the SDP governorship candidate, Danladi Baido had earlier unveiled <strong>Alhaji Ahmed Dattijo</strong> as his running mate for the 2023 governorship election in Taraba state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FxZmtoYmh6ta3RmpmaZaOZvW6wxKegnqtdpbmius2em2allae0pr6MsKCtoF2WvaR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
