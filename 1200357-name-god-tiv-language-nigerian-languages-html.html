It’s interesting that they don’t worship their highest God as other people from other religions do. They say their God doesn’t care much for them. In return, they don’t care much for him, either. The main thing their God has done was the creation of everything, including the evil. Then, the God headed away and the Tiv people never asked him where.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7bvmcjg5v8t.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>ASUU strike: Charlyboy reacts to incessant industrial action in Nigeria</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7bvmcjg5v8t.jpg><p class=align-left>Image source: blogspot.com</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Names of God in Hausa language and their meanings</p><p class=align-left>In general, the Tiv people have more faith in unseen substances that have a certain power over humans. They respect ancestors but their ancestors don’t rule any supernatural forces. The actions that humans take are responsible for the awakening of evil and all the further results. These actions may be influenced by a lump of metaphysical substance called Tsav. This substance often acts like a real organ but gives a person some special abilities.</p><p class=align-left>In the material world, they believe in the so-called Akombo, symbols of powers. They are no way gods or anything near to it. They are something close to what is called the powers of nature in the western world. However, when something bad happens, it’s very likely that Akombo will be in charge for that and steps will be taken to neutralize or destroy the power of this evil force.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/adc6e6178a1c8d6d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Watch video of pastor using mouth to spit water on his members heads</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7deldqd0dvl.jpg><p class=align-left>Image source: facebook.com</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Names of God in different Nigerian languages</p><p class=align-left>It’s interesting that the majority of Tiv religion followers calmly claim that they know well how Akombo rituals are conducted. In fact, it has never been said that it was a kind of mystery. They believe that somebody always knows more about certain things.</p><p class=align-left>If somebody dies without an obvious reason, they say that the God knows why the death has occurred. They believe that there’s always a certain human motif behind any such case but they haven’t discovered it yet. Everything seems to be yet ahead for them.</p><h2>Nigerian nations and their names for god</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/adc6e6178a1c8d6d.jpg><p class=align-left>Image source: facebook.com</p><ul><li>Hausa call their God Ubangidi.
