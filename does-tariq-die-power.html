It seems that Tariq, who is portrayed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Rainey Jr.,</a> just can't stay out of trouble, which has fans wondering:&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Tariq die in Power Season 6?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starz</span></figure><p>Tariq has been close to death so many times during this series. Remember when he was kidnapped by Kanan and Jukebox? Or when he shot and killed Ray Ray as payback for Raina's death?&nbsp;</p><p>It seems that Tariq has nine lives, but fans hope that Season 6 will be the end of the line for the aspiring hustler.&nbsp;</p><p>"Anyways, I caught up on Power and tbh.... can Tariq just die already," one viewer tweeted. Another added, "If Tariq is gonna die in Power, he has to die a horrific death. What a useless son."&nbsp;</p><p>A third chimed in, "The day Tariq dies/goes to prison for life will be a good f--king day." &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who do you hate the most among these four?</p><p>Ramsay (Game Of Thrones)<br>Joffrey (Game Of Thrones)<br>Tariq (Power)<br>T bag (Prison Break) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0sQmTMMjgh</a></p>— MISTAHMASALATI ™️ (@MisterMasalati) <a href=#>October 4, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There is talk of a Power spinoff centered around Tariq.&nbsp;</h2><p>Unfortunately, Tariq might make it out of the Starz series alive as there are rumors that the network is working on a spinoff centered around his character.&nbsp;</p><p>"Today we are pleased to announce that we are in pre-production on the first of what we know will be a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">collection of series</a> inspired by the dynamic world of Power," executive producer Courtney Kemp announced earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Could one of those series revolve around Tariq? No confirmed details yet, but it was just revealed that the prequel series Power Book 2: Ghost will star Mary J. Blige.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starz</span></figure><p>We can definitely see <a href=#>Tariq and his classmate Effie</a> teaming up and trying to start a drug empire of their own —&nbsp;just like Ghost (Omari Hardwick) and Tasha (Naturi Naughton).&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, Ghost will keep trying to keep Tariq off the streets.&nbsp;</p><p>Following his "kidnapping" and his expulsion from school, Ghost — who is clearly in denial — is determined to get Tariq back in the classroom, telling his ex-wife Tasha, "We'll just find a school that will take him and he'll have a life I never had. A real education."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starz</span></figure><p>However, Ghost did have some words of warning for his son. "Keep thinking you're smarter than me," he told Tariq. "Don't ever make that mistake again son."&nbsp;</p><p>Even Keisha (La La Anthony) knows that Tariq is a lost cause, telling Tommy (Joseph Sikora), "Tariq is not the same kid we knew growin' up. He's different now."&nbsp;</p><p>Where is Vincent with his bag of oranges when you need him?&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Power Sunday nights at 9 p.m. EST on Starz.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ytmKuhoWKxqrGMqaawnaI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
