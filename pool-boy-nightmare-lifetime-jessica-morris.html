Can you tease any possible deaths, gore..?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Jessica Morris: </strong>Well, it definitely starts off with a bang, and not everyone does survive. I‚Äôm sure you can tell in the trailer that the character that plays the pool boy is a little bit unhinged and a little obsessive so he definitely does some damage. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>A lot of times in thriller movies, audiences are left with the underlying question of: Is the killer or villain really gone or dead? Is that something we‚Äôll see with this movie? Will it end on a cliffhanger for the story to possibly continue?</strong></p><p><strong>JM</strong>: I honestly don‚Äôt even know because I think we shot two different versions of the ending because they weren‚Äôt really sure which one they wanted to go with. So, I don‚Äôt even know and I haven‚Äôt seen the movie yet. So, I‚Äôm not sure.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>A fun little teaser for ‚ÄúPool Boy Nightmare‚Äù on Lifetimeüòä‚ù§Ô∏èüé¨#lifetime #movie #thriller #actress #comingsoon #laborday #tv #premiere #poolboynightmare #poolboy</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Jessica Morris</a> (@jessicamorris01) on Aug 24, 2020 at 9:33am PDT</p></figure><p><strong>Is that common, to film two endings in a thriller movie?</strong></p><p><strong>JM</strong>: I have not experienced that. I think it‚Äôs cool because it makes it more of a surprise for me to watch it. ‚Ä¶ The writer and director Rolfe Kanefsky, he‚Äôs directed and wrote a lot of horror films. This is a little bit different because it‚Äôs a Lifetime TV movie thriller, so I think that‚Äôs part of it too. The ending he may have wanted might have been a little darker, where they like to wrap things up on Lifetime a little lighter and more final. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>I saw in the teaser posted that you whack the pool boy with the pool skimmer. Nice! Did you do your own stunts for this film?</strong></p><p><strong>JM</strong>: Yeah, I did all my own stunts. That was a fun moment for me to film when I got to hit him with that thing. It‚Äôs one of those moves where it‚Äôs all in how he reacts, which sells it ‚Äòcause obviously I‚Äôm not actually hitting him.</p><p><strong>When doing your own stunts, was there one that was more challenging?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>JM</strong>: There was one scene where I‚Äôm trying to untie somebody and they really had the character zip-tied pretty tightly. We did it again and they ended up cheating it for me, but at first it wasn‚Äôt cheated at all. At first it was really hard to get it undone and pretending that the bad guy is coming to get us and I‚Äôm trying to save their life, but in real life I probably wouldn‚Äôt; we‚Äôd probably both die because I cannot get this thing undone. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Pool Boy Nightmare will premiere on Sept. 7 at 8 pm ET on Lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbywuIybprJlnp60qcDMmqmeZZyes6bAyKacZqKVqMCqr8BmpKiqop7A</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
