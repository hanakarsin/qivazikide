The Belgian-born star became an icon of both film and fashion, starring in countless roles such as Monte Carlo Baby, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and Paris When It Sizzles.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Beyond her untimely death in 1993, Audrey's legacy has been sustained through the likes of both her children and grandchildren. So, who exactly are these individuals, and what role does Audrey's enduring presence have in their lives even today? Here's a breakdown of where Audrey's kids (and grandkids) are now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Audrey Hepburn's kids are now both in the film industry as well.</h2><p>Sean Hepburn Ferrer, age 60, and Luca Dotti, age 51, are Audrey's only two children, and both have sustained her legacy in more ways than one. Half brothers with a common interest in film, Sean and Luca both have impressive accolades in the industry as well.</p><p>Sean, who took an interest in the behind-the-scenes work of the film industry, has held positions working on the development, production, and marketing of films such as Growing Pains, Eye of the Widow, and Racehoss. After his mother's death, he and Luca founded the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund. This fund takes exhibitions of Audrey Hepburn memorabilia across the globe to fund the various humanitarian efforts that she held dear in life.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Luca also took an interest in the film industry like his older half-brother, starring in the likes of I Love Audrey and C Ã  vous. Born in Switzerland, Luca has always maintained that he never saw his mother as the massive worldwide star she was and highlights across multiple interviews her more humble side beyond the glitz and glamour associated with her name. As previously mentioned, Luca is a founding member of the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund and takes great pride in its charitable efforts alongside Sean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Audrey's grandchildren are a mixture of celebrity and low-key individuals.</h2><p>Although she never lived to meet any of them, Audrey's grandchildren have gone on to lead fairly successful lives as well. The star's first grandchild, Emma Ferrer, Sean's daughter, was born only a year after Audrey's passing in 1994. Out of any of her grandchildren, Emma has gone on to have the biggest career in the limelight so far. A model for the likes of Givenchy, Dior, and Tiffany & Co., the movie magnate's granddaughter has clearly fully embraced the modeling genes in her family.</p><p>Gregorio and Santiago Ferrer are Sean's second and third children born in his second marriage. Not much is known about the two of them as neither have really embraced the life of their celebrity parents or grandmother.</p><p>Luca, on the other hand, has kept his personal family life entirely private. Nothing is known of his children; even their names have been kept secret. The only confirmed details regarding Luca's life outside of his occupation and relationship to the Hepburn family name is that he has two younger daughters. He, them, and his wife, Domitilla Bertusi, live in Rome currently.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsKlvsSyZKGdoJfCs7qMpKCdq12jvLg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
