The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI was made aware </a>of the comment at the time. The teenager was also a concern to school staff, and had been banned from carrying a backpack while on the campus.&nbsp;</p><p>In the hours since, social media has, as usual, been a platform for gun reform debate. Especially since the shooting came just short of a year after President Trump rescinded an Obama-era rule aimed at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blocking gun sales to certain mentally ill people</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In an address to the nation during the aftermath, President Donald Trump&nbsp;said he would discuss policies to make schools safer during a meeting with U.S. governors and attorneys general later this month. He added that "it's not enough to take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference -- we must make that difference."&nbsp;</p><p>Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren appears to be one of those opposing stricter gun laws, accusing the left of politicizing the shooting.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can the Left let the families grieve for even 24 hours before they push their anti-gun and anti-gunowner agenda?
