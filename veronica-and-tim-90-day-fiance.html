That wasn't the case with <a href=#>Tim Malcolm</a>, who dated Jeniffer Tarazona on 90 Day Fianc√©: &nbsp;Before the 90 Days on Season 4. After meeting and falling in love with the Colombian beauty online, Tim tried to give his relationship with Jeniffer a try in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>But, Tim and his ex-fianc√©e, Veronica Rodriguez, still appeared to have unfinished business in their relationship, which made Jeniffer uncomfortable.</p><p>After his split from Jeniffer, fans wondered if Tim and Veronica would rekindle their old flame after flirting on the show. The two just appeared on the Dec. 22 episode of <a href=#>90 Day Fianc√©: Pillow Talk</a>, and we have an update on the status of their relationship.</p><p>What's going on with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Veronica and Tim from 90 Day Fianc√©?</a>&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Veronica and Tim from 90 Day Fianc√©'s relationship timeline.&nbsp;</h2><p>Before airing out his relationship woes with Jeniffer on 90 Day Fianc√©: Before the 90 Days, Tim had a long term relationship with Veronica Rodriguez. The two are still present in each other's lives, which proved to be an issue on the show.</p><p>The two first got together when Veronica's now-13-year-old daughter, Chloe, was a toddler, and they stayed together for just under a decade. Tim helped raise Chloe, and he considers her his daughter. Chloe refers to Tim as "Dad," which has helped him have a positive co-parenting relationship with Veronica.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim's close relationship with his ex caused some drama between him and Jeniffer. She noted that she wanted Veronica to be less present in Tim's life before she would consider walking down the aisle with him. Veronica didn't help ease Jeniffer's suspicions; she posted cozy throwback photos with her ex while the show aired.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Tim and Jeniffer</p></figure><p>On the show, Veronica also put pressure on Tim when he wanted to go to Colombia to propose to Jeniffer. She told him that she was concerned that he would forget about his daughter if he were to move somewhere else.</p><p>To add salt to the wound, Veronica gave Tim her old engagement ring to propose to Jeniffer with. Talk about some bad ju-ju.</p><p>After Tim split from Jeniffer, viewers wondered if Jeniffer's suspicions about Tim and his ex were true. Tim set the record straight on the possibility of him reconciling with Veronica in October.</p><p>"A lot of people will comment that they hope Veronica and I get back together, and I always say the same thing ‚Äî that ship has sailed!‚Äù Tim said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. ‚ÄúRomantically we‚Äôre not a good fit, but we‚Äôre great friends and we are good parents to [daughter] Chloe.
