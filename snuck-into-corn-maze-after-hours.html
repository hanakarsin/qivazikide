The TikToker is moving in a hurry: "it's only 6:50, place closes at 7, we'll make it if we speed walk!"</p><p>They didn't make it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @feyesak</span></figure><p>"it's 7:30" the next picture shows. The sky is pitch black. The only thing that stands before her is a dirt ground, darkness, and a cornfield.</p><p>All wasn't lost, however, as the TikToker and their companion found another couple trapped in the maze as well.</p><p>In their next photo they share a picture of what looks like a man and a woman and an overlay reads: "Praise we found 2 couples here" but it looks like she also came across someone else that she wasn't really a fan of: someone who joked that because her and her companion "were black and in the back" that they were going to "die first."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @feyesak</span></figure><p>Disaster strikes the further they go into the maze, however: her and her companion appear to have lost the new travel companions they made as the the following pictures feature more blurred imagery and a text overlay asking: "where did they go????"</p><p>There was a silver lining, however: @feyesak managed to find a checkpoint in the maze, however, the sign indicated that she was less than halfway from the maze's exit.</p><p>Her following picture shows what would be a terrifying photo given the circumstances: a shock of red light in the distance: "WHAT is THAT" she asks.</p><p>Thankfully, it doesn't seem that anything came of the horrifying red lights, however, as the TikToker managed to find the final checkpoint after an additional 30 minutes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @feyesak</span></figure><p>The next photo showed sweet, sweet victory: they escaped the corn maze and didn't leave empty handed: she snapped a photo of her grabbing "pumpkins for emotional damage" that the "place caused" her and her companion.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @feyesak</span></figure><p>The final image in the slideshow showed an overhead view of the corn maze and how massive it was, something that @feyesak didn't appear to have been prepared for: "searched this place up after I got home...
