However, now that many of the older siblings have reached adulthood, they haven't appeared much on the TLC reality series. One of Kody and Christine's children, <a href=#>Mykelti Brown</a>, recently announced her second pregnancy, prompting fans to wonder: Who is her husband? Keep reading to learn all about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Padron</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mykelti Brown's husband Tony Padron wasn't immediately liked by her family.</h2><p>In an episode of Sister Wives when the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Browns met Tony's parents</a> and siblings for the first time, Kody aptly summed up Mykelti's then-fiancé's quirky and playful personality.</p><p>"There's something about Tony," Kody told producers, with a smile. "He's always joking around, he's always pushing buttons. But it seems really simple and safe. He never offends me except when he — and it doesn't offend me — but he does things that are really politically incorrect."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@tonychessnut</span></figure><p>Ahead of connecting with the soon-to-be in-laws, the Browns were mostly nervous about the language barrier. Tony's parents, Maria and Antonio, were born in Mexico. And although they had lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years (Tony was born in San Francisco), they speak minimal English.</p><p>Christine was also anxious about meeting the Padrons because she wasn't initially a fan of Tony when he and Mykelti started dating. She explained: "I wasn't really keen on Tony and Mykelti at first ... So my biggest concern is what if Tony's mom knows that I wasn't very accepting at first. And that would be really hard."</p><p>Ultimately, the meeting ended up going well, and Mykelti and Tony are married today.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mykelti and Tony have welcomed a daughter — and are expecting twins!</h2><p>On Dec. 17, 2016, Tony and Mykelti officially tied the knot. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Preparation for their big day</a>, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the wedding itself</a>, was featured on Sister Wives.

"WE’RE HAVING TWINS!!!!" she captioned the post. "Tony and I definitely weren’t planning this or expecting it but we’re both excited for our upcoming adventure and all the chaos and love it brings."</p><p>Mykelti and Tony released exclusive photos of their pregnancy announcement via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine. They also shared their excitement about expecting two more babies.</p><p>"I'm extremely excited for the twins to come," Mykelti told the publication.

And who knows? Perhaps her journey will also be documented in an upcoming season of Sister Wives.</p><p>Congrats to Mykelti and Tony on their two little ones on the way!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfosasscutoGaaoqTEr3nHrqqbmZ6Z</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
