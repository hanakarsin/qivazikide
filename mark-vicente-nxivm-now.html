Founder Keith Raniere and his associate, <a href=#>Smallville actress Allison Mack</a>, were indicted on charges of sex trafficking in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>The women involved in NXIVM purportedly take a vow to the group, which includes getting branded with a logo that resembles Keith's initials, K.R.</p><p>The group, the accusations against it, and the details of joining are being told for the first time at length in the HBO docuseries The Vow.

He originally joined the group in 2005 as a means to get more guidance on his career. He ultimately rose to the level of a "senior proctor" within it. In this elevated role, he interacted on a daily basis with Raniere.&nbsp;</p><p>He has stated that he was unaware about NXIVM's association with sexual slavery and forced labor when he first joined.&nbsp;</p><p>He eventually divulged his most personal secrets to higher members of the group, and he felt as though they would use that information against him.&nbsp;</p><p>In August of 2020, he spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> about coming to the decision to leave the group, and document what was really going on behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>"I began to understand what was going to happen to us. They had so much money, so much power, I realized, 'Oh they're going to frame us for a whole bunch of things...' I realized I had to document everything because, if this thing went south, and they turned it around on us, then I had to have some kind of proof of what we were actually trying to do," he explained to the outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>After testifying against Keith Raniere in court in the spring of 2019, Mark regained control of his life.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>He and wife Bonnie are now living in Portugal, and they've spoken out on their respective Instagram pages about how they've been trying to heal since their involvement with the group.&nbsp;</p><p>In June of 2020, Mark commemorated his 55th birthday with an emotional post about the fallout he's dealt with since he exposed NXIVM.</p><p>"My birthday is always a strange thing. Celebratory in the sense that I am here, I am alive. I have survived so far. Then there's sadness at time gone by and memories... so many memories ('SAUDADE' - as the Portuguese say) and then there's the existential marker on the timeline of my life," he stated. "Every birthday involves some massive introspective, existential examination."</p><p>"And yet, I could say this particular existential marker has been going on for 3 years: Help bring about Justice √ (check) Lose MANY cherished people I care about √ &nbsp;Turn my life upside down √ Regain my soul √ — But, there are gifts to these challenges and I am SO grateful," he wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>My birthday is always a strange thing. Celebratory in the sense that I am here, I am alive. I have survived so far. Then there's sadness at time gone by and memories… so many memories (‘SAUDADE' - as the Portuguese say) and then there’s the existential marker on the timeline of my life. Every birthday involves some massive introspective, existential examination. And yet, I could say this particular existential marker has been going on for 3 years: Help bring about Justice √ (check) Lose MANY cherished people I care about √ Turn my life upside down √ Regain my soul √ — But, there are gifts to these challenges and I am SO grateful. I now have a trusted circle of friends who know what it is to stand in the fire with me. I have incredible creative partners, people who champion me, and shoulders to cry on. I find myself immersed in an explosion of art and creativity like never before. I am so grateful to my Mother, who is still with me. My Grandfather, Grandmother and Fathers who long ago passed away. My heritage, both good and bad, has formed me. I am beyond fortunate to have my magnificent warrior of a Wife. Deep, profound, insightful and loving. Everyday, she fights for what is right and fights FOR me. Today, I know I am a very lucky man. I have been moulded in hot fire; stretched, folded, pounded, shaped and reshaped. I am glimpsing who I wanted to become so long ago. It was never about possessions, status, renown… wealth is now measured by the quality of friendship, soulfulness and love. Thank you to all of you! I AM BECOMING… I feel fibers of strength growing inside of me. Steely resolve and passion. There is no greater privilege than to materialize myself. So here I am at 55. Full of feelings, fire, piss and vinegar, longing, joy, laughter, humor and gratitude.
