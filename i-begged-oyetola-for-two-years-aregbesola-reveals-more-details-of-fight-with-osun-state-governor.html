I sent people to help me beg him that he should not destroy my legacies and policies. He refused the pleas.</p><p>“Our hope is in God and the good people of Osun State. Nobody can overcome God. It is not a sin to contest for a position in a democratic government. The constitution of the party stipulates that after four years, we can change our candidate. But if he abides by the tenets of the party, we will support him for another term,” <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Aregbesola stated</a></strong>.</p><p>Speaking further, the Minister said there’s no going back in his total support for the former Secretary to the State Government, Moshood Adeoti to emerge as the APC flagbearer in the party primary election scheduled for Saturday, 19th February (today) to choose a candidate for the July 16 governorship polls.</p><p>“The leaders of the party have agreed that we should go back to where we missed the road in 2018. We have realized our mistake that the person we ought to put in front, we neglected him. We followed an ingrate and a wicked soul,” he told the people of Ayedaade/Isokan/Irewole Federal Constituency who were at the meeting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5ByZqJlkpq0qLHDZqaynaSkuaJ5xaipZqynpHq6scCrqmaZopq0o7HSqKOaZaKaw6aty6xkpqeimnqlsdOaoKWrXaSzbrLIoJ%2BtZaeewal5zqysp2Wjqa61sYygpq%2BdoqO8s3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
