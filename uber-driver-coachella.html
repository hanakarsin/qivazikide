And in a now-viral clip, she talks about the time she went to Coachella when a guy began flirting with her.</p><p>Turns out the dude was a thief who decided to relieve her of her wallet, phone, and keys.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@becccamooore href=#>@becccamooore</a><p>the uber driver that saved me from going missing is @buds4u559!! ðŸ˜­ after spending the day w him he told me his daughter is a senior in high school & is having a hard time going through chemo. i made a gofundme, he couldâ€™ve left me and didnâ€™t have to help me the way he did! Iâ€™d love to help his fam give his daughter a normal end to her senior year of high school this year (prom!!) iâ€™m putting it in my bio!!</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - becca moore" href=#>â™¬ original sound - becca moore</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>She begins the video by stating: "I went to Coachella this weekend and I thought this guy was kinda hitting on me but then he just robbed me."</p><p>She explained the situation to staff members at the hotel, who called an Uber on her behalf so they could take her to a nearby cell phone store so she could purchase a new device.</p><p>And she ended up making an ally in the process.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>That ally was Uber driver Raul Torres: "A normal Uber driver takes you to a place and then drops you off. He insisted on coming in with me and making sure that I was gonna have a ride after that," Becca said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>The two decided to team up to try and find the perpetrator who stole from the Influencer. Raul took Becca to the police station to file a report and managed to uncover the alleged thief's identity.</p><p>Raul then accompanied Becca and the police officers who searched for her belongings, but they came up short. Raul didn't stop helping her, however.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>Ultimately they were able to locate the phone, presumably using "Find my iPhone" or a similar feature, and thankfully they were able to find the phone. It was left outside of an Airbnb.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>Becca was thoroughly touched by Raul's commitment to helping her get her phone back and during their journey to recover her belongings, they got Starbucks and then went out for margaritas together after the wild goose chase.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>"We went on an entire adventure from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, which shouldâ€™ve been an entire day of work for him, and towards the end of the day is when I started realizing he actually needed more help than I did," local news outlet KGET reported the Influencer as saying.</p><p>The outlet also highlighted the dedication Raul had to hustling: he drove all the way from Fresno, Calif. to Indio, Calif. in order to more rides from Coachella attendees so he could give some cash to his teenage daughter â€” it's a five and a half hour drive.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>Becca also learned that both Raul's daughter and father were diagnosed with cancer and he helps to take care of the both of them. After seeing how much he was willing to help her despite everything that was going on in his life, Becca launched a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe</a> to assist the Uber Driver and tell people about her positive interactions with him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>"So usually I use my platform to talk about like, boys, my dating life and stupid things that now I really see are just surface level. It means a lot that I can help him back," Becca said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @becccamooore</span></figure><p>"So yeah, that man stole my phone, my keys, my credit cards. You know what he gave me? Friendship with Raul, so it was worth it."</p><p>Becca's crowdfunding campaign helped to raise nearly $200,000 for the Uber Driver as of this writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqq%2BmvoydqaKulad6pLvAnJ%2BepJyW</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
