They are still nursing their injuries from the by-election loss. I believe they were not happy with me a they thought I was the pivot of ANC support, but I take it happily and courageously and I hope to move forward.I wouldn't want to castigate ODM so much because ODM has nurtured me. I was elected on its ticket when I was a member of the Kakamega County Assembly, and I became deputy speaker on an ODM ticket. I was the first deputy speaker to be impeached in the county, so I am used to these tribulations," Malala said.<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: <a href=#>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB feed</a></p><p class=align-left>However, the former ward representative lashed out at ODM for 'dominating' other parties in parliament despite having a coalition agreement with Wiper, ANC and Ford Kenya outfits.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c040f2b46a2ea794.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sifuna, Murkomen Clap Back at Mudavadi's ANC for Threatening to Deal with ODM Following Malala's Ouster</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He argued his position, which was awarded to Kilifi senator, Steward Madzayo, should have been given to an ANC member.</p><h3>Malala kicked out</h3><p class=align-left>The decision to <a href=#>kick out</a> Malala was reached during a National Super Alliance (NASA) Parliamentary Group meeting hastily convened by Siaya senator, James Orengo, who doubles up as Senate minority leader.</p><p class=align-left>During the meeting on Wednesday, March 24, all the 20 ODM senators reportedly appended their signatures in favour of his ouster.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news.
