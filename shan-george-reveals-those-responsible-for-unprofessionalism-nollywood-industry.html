It is very much about what my current job in Nollywood entails.”</p><p>Going down memory lane on how she joined the movie industry, she said, “My journey into Nollywood began in 1996, when I attended an audition for a movie role at Maryland, Lagos. It was not even planned. I just escorted my sister there, and I also auditioned to play a part in the movie titled, ‘Thorns of Rose’, and produced by Emeka Osai. At that point, I was already acting a role in the nationwide NTA soap opera, ‘Winds of Destiny’, directed by Sadiq Daba. The journey has been great so far.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze49rZqygkaN6qLHOq56eZaKaw6aty6xkraCfqLJuvsSsp6imo56vrbGMn6arZaWjvbO7xZ6qrKGfo66ttdKmZKennKHGuLvOnWSippSqwLW%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
