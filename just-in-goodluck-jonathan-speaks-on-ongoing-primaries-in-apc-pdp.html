This is not a standard practice. The process has failed.</p><p>“We cannot use the process to elect president, governors, senators and House of Representatives members and others.</p><p>“The process is already failed, which is not good for the country. But we will manage and move on.</p><p>“We pray that good people should come. I hope that what happened this year, 2022 will not happen again in this country.”</p><p>He called on the National Assembly to make laws to criminalise the inducement of delegates and the electorate.</p><p>Jonathan urged lawmakers to expunge from the Electoral Act, the sections that state how political parties should select candidates for elections.</p><p>Jonathan said: “The National Assembly can’t make laws and lock all political parties together. Parties have different ways of nominating candidates and the process is enshrined in their constitutions.</p><p>“Creating a situation where all parties must have the same way of selecting candidates is nonsense. Parties are not parastatals of government.</p><p>“The National Assembly can’t make laws to strangulate political parties. Section 84 should be expunged from the Electoral Act.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FvZqOto6l6qrqMoKaonJyqsKx5yailmqyYlrtuv8%2BemKSrXaS7brvNoKaippdivbO1zJqpop2jYravecCpmmaolKV8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
