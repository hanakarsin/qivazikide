Despite lots of rumours and speculations surrounding that tragedy, multiple sources, including TheNation, Linda Ikeji Blog, others confirm that the actor has actually passed away.</strong></p><p class=align-left>Many media outlets had reported that the actor had passed away in the afternoon of Sunday, January 18, 2015, in a hospital in Festac, Lagos.</p><p class=align-left>However, a couple of hours later several&nbsp;tweets posted on @MunaObiekwe Twitter account returned hope to the hearts of thousands of fans. The tweets declared that the actor&nbsp;was still hale and hearty.</p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, soon it was clear that&nbsp;the twitter handle @MunaObiekwe&nbsp;was not the real twitter account of Muna. Below are other tweets that attest to the fact that the popular actor is dead:</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Richest artist in Nigeria</a></p><p class=align-left>But it was proved to be fake by fellow actors in the Nollywood scene like Empress Njama and Mike Ezeronye&nbsp;claiming the actor is truly dead.</p><p class=align-left><i>"#Muna RIP#i have worked with u on many occasions n ur nt just a good actor but a person with sense of humor n a funny guy too! We will miss u!God knows best!sleep on! Go n take thy rest! Goodnight,"</i> the actress wrote on her Instagram posting a photo of the late colleague.</p><p class=align-left>According to Linda Ikeji,&nbsp;Muna needed money for his health problems but instead of going public to raise money, he told friends he was planning a stage play to raise money but died before he could do it.</p><p class=align-left>Muna is widely known for his potrayal in x-rated movies and an x-rated photo of himself and Biola Ige, circulated in online media for a while.</p><p class=align-left>Until his death, the Enugu based actor was one of the controversial actors in the Nigerian movie industry.</p><p class=align-left>The late Muna, who had a knack for acting romantic scenes, once came under attack for grabbing fellow actor, Biola Ige’s breast, in the movie, Pregnant Hawker.</p><p class=align-left>However, the actress later denied the story, claiming that the picture which went viral was doctored and that there was no such scene in the movie.</p><p class=align-left>Muna on his own part was quoted to have said:&nbsp;<i>“…I don’t remember the movie. I also don’t remember sucking Biola’s breasts. If the movie exists, that scene never took place.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Like I told you, I don’t recall the movie. I do a lot of movies and I can’t remember what happens in all of them.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"The fact that I don’t recall means that the movie was shot a long time ago. Probably three or more years back. When love scene was in vogue with producers. I’m still searching for the movie to acquaint myself with the story.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“There has never been anything between myself and any actress that I’ve made a movie with. My romantic relationships have always been outside the movie industry. I don’t take my work home.”</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHeBkG9pZpufo8Gzu9WeqayhkaF6oq%2FTqKlmpaWjrm67waKcpK%2BVYrGqsdJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
