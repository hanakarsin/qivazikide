What happened to Big Time Rush?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The band <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Time Rush</a> hasn't been performing together since their TV show ended in 2013, unless you count that <a href=#>Zoom performance</a> they did together during quarantine in 2020. But that was enough to give fans hope that the group would be getting back together.</p><p>But what happened to Big Time Rush? What caused the Nickelodeon band to go their separate ways? The answer may not be what you expect, but they may be getting together to perform sooner rather than later. Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Big Time Rush?</h2><p>Much like with One Direction saying that they were on a break but not breaking up, Big Time Rush kind of did the same thing. Though their Nickelodeon comedy show of the same name ended in 2013, the band didn't exactly end at the same time.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost</a>, Carlos PenaVega (neé Peña), Kendall Schmidt, James Maslow, and Logan Henderson said that the show was indeed over and band was likely not putting out music for a while. And they were pretty blunt about it.</p><p>"We’ve all known for five years that we’re ready for our individual careers," Carlos said. But he clarified his thought, indicating that it didn't mean the band wouldn't ever make new music together again: "I think it’ll just help the band if we give people time to miss us — it’s kind of like a relationship. [...] I think that we’ve been around for five years is great. Now, we’re leaving for a little bit."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Kendall did jump in to say, "Or won’t come back at all." While that sounds like he was saying that Big Time Rush was over, he also explained his thoughts a little further: "It’s sort of like a thin line to walk on, because we have a lot of fans who love Big Time Rush and we don’t want to ever disappoint them. We want them to be fans of individuals whenever we go and do our own things."</p><p>"In terms of new content, it might be a while, but might not be ever," James added. "We don’t know at this point and we’ve all kind of been saying, 'We’re all really excited and really antsy to be our own individual artists outside the band — and support each other.'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Great news, Rushers! Big Time Rush is back in action.</h2><p>In 2014, Kendall spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebSecrets</a> and was asked if BTR was getting back together, to which he responded, "BTR hasn't ever broken up."</p><p>During this interview and again in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2016 interview with Bustle</a>, Kendall confirmed that, if the band were to reunite, it might not be to put out new music, but it would definitely include a tour.</p><p>In 2018, in honor of the band's nine-year anniversary, Carlos posted a tribute to the group on Instagram, saying, "Shall we do a 10-year reunion tour for next year?" Thankfully, in 2021, those tour hints came to a head when the group announced Big Time Rush Live, a series of concerts across the United States.</p><p>Even more exciting, the group is performing at the 2022 <a href=#>Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> and kicking off a tour in June 2022. If you're a BTR fan, 2022-2023 is going to be a great year!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSboZdiwaq5xGaprquY</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
