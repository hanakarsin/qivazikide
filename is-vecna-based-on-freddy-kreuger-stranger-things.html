Boasting many similarities to Freddy Krueger, is Vecna based on him?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Before we even get into anything, we beg of everyone, stop thirsting over this godforsaken supernatural creature on the internet. No more talk of flesh tentacles. The Duffer Brothers' <a href=#>Stranger Things</a> Season 4 welcomes a new murderous Upside Down villain and his name is Vecna, after the zombie-like wizard from Dungeons & Dragons.</p><p>And while Demogorgons are certainly petrifying, Vecna is a sly, manipulative, English-speaking humanoid being, one who can't help but latch onto those with underlying trauma. No offense, but the dog-like Demogorgons don't seem to be quite as smart.</p><p>With a gruesome face only a mother could love, Vecna's skin is decrepit (he's got to get on that 10-step Korean skincare regimen) and he has a thing for terrorizing teenagers. Does this sound familiar? Perhaps a certain red-and-green striped sweater will help ring a bell. Or maybe the iconic line "I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy." We could go on and on. The sadistic Vecna and A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger boast a slew of similarities. So, is the Stranger Things beast based on the '80s horror icon?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Vecna based on Freddy Krueger?</h2><p>In short, sort of. “We really wanted to go scary and explore the types of villains that shook us the most when we were kids,” Matt Duffer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>.</p><p>While dream-stalker Freddy Krueger is one of those villains, the genius Duffer Brothers also pulled inspiration from Pinhead of Clive Barker’s 1987 film Hellraiser and the OG Pennywise — played by the incomparable Tim Curry — of the 1990 It miniseries.</p><p>“I was already scared of clowns. My mom was in the bedroom for two weeks just until I fell asleep," Matt said of Pennywise.</p><p>Regarding Freddy, Pinhead, and Pennywise collectively, Matt explained that “there's something very tangible about them,” and that “they’re intelligent, they're sentient, they're there.”</p><p>A Demogorgon isn't going to tap into your worst memories, playing with your mind like a sickening video game.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stranger Things Netflix (@strangerthingstv)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jamie Campbell Bower discussed how he subtly channeled Freddy Krueger while playing Vecna.</h2><p>"I was like, 'Yeah, Hellraiser, I'll take a bit of that, a little bit of Freddy [Krueger].' But not too much Freddy, because the way Robert [Englund] played Freddy, there was a chaotic energy," actor Jamie Campbell Bower told Entertainment Weekly of his role.</p><p>"With Vecna, I saw this resentment, this really built-up anger. You know when you get so angry, you start shaking, you're trying to hold it together? That's what I took." It's all about lingering, controlled chaos.</p><p>Speaking of Robert Englund — who played the infamous Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise — he has a supporting role in Season 4 of the <a href=#>Netflix</a> series. Robert plays incarcerated killer Victor Creel in Episode 4, titled "Chapter Four: Dear Billy."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Robert Englund in 'Stranger Things' Season 4</p></figure><p>Hilariously, the nerdy Duffer Brothers popped by the set specifically when Robert Englund was shooting his scenes.</p><p>"The day I shot with Robert was one of the very few times that the Duffers made a point of coming to set just to hang out and nerd out with Robert England," executive producer Shawn Levy told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>. Shawn also directed Episode 4.</p><p>"I will soon be unleashing my treasure trove of behind-the-scenes pictures from the Season 4 shoot, and one of my favorites is of Matt and Ross Duffer talking to Robert Englund while wearing Freddy Krueger T-shirts. That's what delightful film geeks the Duffer brothers truly are."
