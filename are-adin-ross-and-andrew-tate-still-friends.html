Despite Adin repeatedly vocalizing his support for Tate and his brother Tristan on his platform, sometimes collaborating with him on streams and other content, it seems Tate's legal issues have been making it harder for the two to spend time together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@adinross; Getty Images</a></figure><p>When Tate was initially arrested in late 2022, Adin was criticized by his followers for not traveling out to Romania to visit him, despite being one of the only people cleared for visitation. Adin claimed that if he made the trip to Romania, he would've been arrested, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GameRant</a>, though he offered no further clarification as to why he would also find himself detained by Romanian law enforcement.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Adin Ross revealed during a stream that Andrew Tate was planning to leave Romania.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Adin read aloud some text messages from Tate during a stream, suggesting that the "king of misogyny" was planning to leave Romania following various charges.</p><p>‚ÄúAndrew had hit me up.
