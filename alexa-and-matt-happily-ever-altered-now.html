When they first started dating, Matt had just left the Air Force, and Alexa had lost more than 150 pounds after getting gastric bypass surgery. The two would communicate for hours on the internet, and they soon fell in love.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few years of dating, the couple got engaged, and Alexa found the opportunity to apply for the show while she was perusing a bridal group on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>When they were accepted for Happily Ever Altered, Matt and Alexa had the opportunity to get several surgical procedures done on parts of their bodies that they had been uncomfortable with. For Matt, this meant getting liposuction on his stomach, and he also did a few treatments on his teeth.</p><p>Alexa had loose skin from her weight loss, which she got removed. She also got a tummy tuck, had a breast lift, received implants, and she got veneers for her teeth.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the nature of the Lifetime special, there are no public photos of what the couple looks like now, but there is an update on whether or not they said "I do."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Alexa and Matt get married?</h2><p>During all of these intense procedures, Matt and Alexa were barred from seeing one another (though they were able to speak to each other through a screen).
