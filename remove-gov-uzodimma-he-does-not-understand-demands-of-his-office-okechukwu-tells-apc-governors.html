How many more malfeasance do we still expect from my big brother, before he is eased out of vital assignments?</p><p>“How can a sane Chairman of APC Governors Forum deliberately breach the extant laws by announcing result with impunity, albeit consigned to the dust bin his elementary knowledge that it is the sole duty of the Returning Officer?</p><p>“Based on the foregoing, is it appropriate for chairman of Progressive Governors Forum to abandon the more germane issue of advising Mr President alongside with other progressive governors on how best to rescue Nigeria from the dire economic doldrums, thus chasing rat while the house is burning?</p><p>“For me, it is obvious that Uzodimma seems not to understand the demands of his office as chairman Progressive Governors Forum, but chooses to meddle with political assignments, which amounts to chasing rat while the house is on fire.</p><p>“Moreover, our party should take serious steps to quickly repair the monumental damage that Governor Hope Uzodimma has done to the image of our national chairman, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, whom he cajoled into endorsement of his cancelled shambolic primary election.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FqZqudnaTDpnnGqK1mraqksaq5zJpkoZ1dmbymv4ynpq1lpaOxpr7SrZinnF2Zsq6tzZ2qZqeWYrWqv4yonZ%2Bhk5p6sLfEnJ%2Buo6eqerWxy6WqZpmgmHqou9Weqaenoqh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
