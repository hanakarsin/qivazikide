Washington (Tamala Jones) recently played Michelle a voice recording pulled from her phone after the accident, and we even saw a flashback of the women when they were younger, arguing at their father's birthday party.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>While the mystery of her character has been building for weeks, Episode 8 finally gave us a little bit of resolution. Toward the end of "Monster Inside," we see a confused-looking woman staring out of a tent, and she appears to be Iris.</p><p>Good news for Michelle, in other words: Her sister is still alive. "I picked up on Iris still being alive a few weeks ago," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> one observant fan. "While at the camp, someone made reference to 'the crazy lady in the blue tent' and somehow, I just knew."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who plays Iris on '9-1-1: Lonestar'?</h2><p>We can't wait to learn all the missing bits about Michelle's sister, Iris, when the two-part series finale airs, but in the meantime, we were more than a bit curious about the actress who plays her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Meet Iris. @911lonestar has been a very rewarding experience. @misslivalittle you are the most loving and kind tv sis a girl could only dream of.

We first came to know Lyndsy from her portrayal of Colleen Carlton on The Young and the Restless, but the actress really cemented herself in our memories as Dylan Mayfair on Desperate Housewives.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, she's filming a new television series, Turner & Hooch, based on Tom Hanks' 1989 movie by the same name. Lyndsy is set to play Laura, protagonist Scott's sister, mother of Matthew and owner of dogs with special needs, one of whom is the titular Hooch.</p><p>We can't wait to see more of Lyndsy when the Disney+ series comes out, and look forward to learning more about her character, Iris, when 9-1-1: Lone Star airs Monday at 8 p.m. on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60edOhmK1lmae2tHnArWStoJVisq%2BwjKidZnFhZnqtu82eqq2Zog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
