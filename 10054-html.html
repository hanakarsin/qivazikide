Braide said the police commiserated with the family of the deceased but wanted them to assist by giving information on the whereabouts of the eyewitness who was with the deceased when he was shot.</p><p>The police spokesperson argued that Omene flew down to Nigeria for the deceased’s wedding and should not have been in a hurry to fly back after his friend was killed. “He was the sole eyewitness and we understand that he fled the country 48 hours after the man was shot dead. We need him to assist us in our investigation. He came down from abroad for the man’s wedding and should not have been in a hurry to flee the country when the police needed him most. He is the sole eyewitness that will be able to state categorically what actually transpired.” Continuing, she said it would not be proper to conclude that the man was shot dead by the police.</p><p>“We need to talk to his runaway friend. He has some questions to answer. We need his address. We are presently waiting for him to return home to assist the force in its investigation but if he fails to come home, we have the means to bring him back.” She maintained that, “the sole witness did not make any statement at the police station. He also left his friend in the pool of his own blood and ran to the deceased’s family instead of rushing him to the hospital. His action is questionable. He has serious questions to answer.” “Nigerians will be shocked after the investigation is concluded. We are still investigating, we will still brief Nigerians when we conclude our investigation.”</p><p>She further said that it was very strange for the empty shell of the bullet used in killing the man to have disappeared because “we would have taken it to the ballistic section for analysis but all the same, the autopsy result will unravel many things because the man was shot at very close range.”</p><p>Ozuah was shot dead at the UPS Junction in Gbagada, at about 10.00p.m last Thursday while seeing off his friend who had visited him at home. He was murdered five days after he got married to his wife, Joan at The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM).</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnF8lG1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
