Thousands and millions of books, music pieces, artworks, and other stuff are just clicks away. It’s a means of communication and something that helps people stay in touch even if they are separated by distances and oceans.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>List of computer professional bodies in Nigeria and their functions</p><p class=align-left>The Internet is something that keeps the entire planet united and in case you need something, you can ask on the Web and receive an answer and get some help and support and even find finance if you need. Still, the usefulness of the Internet access to the students is still questioned. Let’s try to find out what the benefits of Internet access to students.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/70362d13b8133603.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazon my reviews section: discover how to find, edit and delete your feedback</span></p></a><h2>Top advantages of the internet for students</h2><ul><li>Access to the information</li></ul><p class=align-left>What do students need to complete their projects and assignments? They need information. The Internet has plenty of information of different types, from different sources. This is exactly what a student may need to build up an opinion or to find grounds for a point of view. There’s nothing better for a clever argument than knowing several opinions regarding the same matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/70362d13b8133603.jpeg><p class=align-left>You may say, all this information is available in libraries. Of course, it is. However, the time required for searching through library catalogues and books cannot be compared to the time one spends on searching for the necessary information on the Internet. Everything is found quickly.</p><ul><li>Access to communication</li></ul><p class=align-left>Communication via phones is gradually becoming less popular than communication via the Internet. The Internet can reach places that are not accessible to phones. The Internet allows sending people messages when phone calls are inappropriate or impossible and the recipient will still be able to get the information.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/36e28c20a6aac75f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the usefulness of the UNN portal!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The communication includes specialized forums where people give advice, ask for help, recommend, share useful information, and so on. Being a member of such a website means having plenty of possibilities and a lot of virtual friends who can help at a tough moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4lhltg15gq7.jpeg><p class=align-left>What’s more, a student can communicate with students from other countries and share experience, ask for advice or help, complete projects and so on. This is a very useful feature of the Internet, which can be more than just useful in the student’s life.</p><ul><li>The most recent data</li></ul><p class=align-left>No matter how modern libraries are, they are not able to render the newest information like the one the Internet can provide. It’s impossible to get access to the most up-to-date information quickly if you don’t have access to the Internet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/36e28c20a6aac75f.jpeg><ul><li>Online study options</li></ul><p class=align-left>There’s no place like the Internet where a person can receive such a wide spectrum of free training of a high quality. Students are free to choose the disciplines they study within their curriculum or the ones they are interested in as a hobby and study them deeper and more effectively. It’s even possible to obtain certificates and diplomas after such training programs and even get professions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a5a34b4067820853.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most popular forms and types of communication</span></p></a><ul><li>Online tests and test results</li></ul><p class=align-left>Some, if not the majority, of tests and exams are now conducted via the Internet. If a student has no access to the Internet, it will be quite hard to participate in such an event. The same is with the results of such tests. They are mostly sent out through the Web and there are no other ways to receive them safely and securely. Having the access to the Internet is vital in such situations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt74lcq25ob1c.jpeg><ul><li>Receiving help online</li></ul><p class=align-left>One of the most important features of the Internet for the students is their access to practically instant assignment help. It’s necessary only to ask for help and there will be people who are ready to share some information, explain something, give a hint or provide with useful links. It’s a very handy opportunity because it’s not always easy to manage all the tasks successfully on one’s own.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/87f7e6fff021a74d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to send bulk SMS if you never did it before</span></p></a><ul><li>The access to useful programs and applications</li></ul><p class=align-left>There are numerous useful programs and applications on the Web that may be useful to students, starting with drawing ones for technical purposes and dictionaries for foreign languages and ending with time-management applications that help build up a time-efficient daily routine.</p><h2>Drawbacks of the Internet for students</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3notg62kvqt.jpeg><p class=align-left>However, there are certain drawbacks of having a constant access to the Internet that can be harmful for studying. For instance, the access to social media can steal a lot of time and instead of handling assignments and studying properly students sit in their WhatsApp accounts or check Instagram pictures of their friends and celebrities.</p><p class=align-left>The Internet provides the access to everything one may want: music, movies, video games and so on, which can draw a person directly from the process of studying. Again, the assignment help is a two-sided coin. On one hand, it can be useful and on the other hand, it can be dangerous because some students will eventually lose the skill of handling their assignments on their own, without any help.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt3niht84rtdkg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Check out these 50 excellent debate topics for students</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It’s possible that there are other dangerous effects of access to the Web on students but if you were initially interested in why Internet is useful for students, here we have several quite obvious reasons.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 online jobs for students in Nigeria</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKDlW1rb2WSmrumssitqmahnqmys7rErWSsrKWZsq%2FA0mefraWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
