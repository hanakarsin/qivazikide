It might not be the most popular decision to take, but I believe it is absolutely necessary. The maladministration in Ogun State requires that every sensible indigene of this state must be ready to make a sacrifice and must be ready to do whatever takes to change the course and the trajectory of government come 2023.</p><p>“In 2019, I ran for the governorship of this state under the APM and my brother and this great party, the PDP, stood by me and it reflected clearly in the result of that election. We will do everything we can to make sure that this party becomes victorious come 2023. We will work morning and afternoon, we will work at night. We will work round the clock. We have done it before in under 90 days; now we have seven months to do this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49yZmtoYmh6orLTnqlmnKWivaq6xmaYqZtdlrqwv9SnqmabkaOxqrDArZxmmZueu62tw55knqWVp7Smv4ypm6lll6TDpr7NqKmsoJmlerPBzaegp59doq61sY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
