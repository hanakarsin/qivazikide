That’s especially true with the newly announced Partner Plus Program, which offers a 70% share of net subscription revenue.</p><p>Here’s a look at how to join Twitch Partner Plus, along with whether or not it's worth the hype.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How to join Twitch Partner Plus.</h2><p>Joining Twitch Partner Plus is straightforward — if you maintain a sub count of at least 350 recurring paid subscriptions for three months, you’ll be automatically enrolled. Your membership will be valid for 12 months (even if your subscription count falls below the 350 limit).</p><p>Twitch is rolling out the Partner Plus tier on Oct. 1, and anyone who meets the membership criteria over the next few months will automatically be enrolled and notified when the tier launches later this year.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitch</span></figure><p>There is a limit to the 70% split of subscription revenue, however, as it maxes out at $100,000 per year. Pass that limit, and your revenue will return to standard Partner rates (which is a 50% split).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Twitch Partner Plus worth it?</h2><p>Considering you don’t have to do anything out of the ordinary to join Twitch Partner Plus, it’s definitely a nice perk. Of course, not many folks will qualify for the plan (there are reports that say only about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1,000 streamers</a> meet the criteria), and with millions of streamers on the platform, that’s a pretty small club.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How many streamers are technically eligible for the new <a href=#>#Twitch</a> Partner Plus program? 🤔</p><p>✅ During the last 3 months, 42.3K partners were active on Twitch.<br>🟣 Only 1K of them had 350+ monthly subs (excl. prime and gifts)</p><p>MEANING: 2.5% of active partners can access Partner+ 👀 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xHARX3g22s</a></p>— Streams Charts 🇺🇦 (@StreamsCharts) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>It’s also worth noting that creators used to always receive a 70/30 revenue split. That recently changed to be just 50/50 – a move that was met with widespread anger from the community. This seems to be an attempt to right that wrong, although many folks don’t think it’s nearly enough.</p><p>“I feel for the creators who are trying to make a living off Twitch,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one user</a>. “Jumping ship may be a solid plan now, but we can’t really predict what will happen with the other platforms. We need to remember Mixer, and use it as an example of a platform with high expectations that failed.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>With Twitch’s new Partner Plus programme</p><p>The difference between 1 sub is £282</p><p>Everyone under $100,000 revenue should get a 70:30 split, not just people over 350 subs <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CqfwDO4QWM</a></p>— Andy Castell (@AJ3) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p><a href=#>Mixer</a>, of course, was Microsoft’s attempt at a streaming platform that has since closed its doors.</p><p>There are plenty of other places to stream, such as YouTube Gaming, that offer a better revenue split to streamers. But the larger revenue split may not make up for a smaller pool of viewers. Twitch has clearly established itself as the best place to stream, even if it continues to make controversial decisions.</p><p>“Our focus has always been on inspiring, growing, and sustaining Twitch streamers all around the world,” reads a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joint statement</a> from Mike Minton, chief monetization officer, and Laura Lee, chief content officer. “We hope this new program demonstrates that commitment.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the community feels that this is truly the case, and it’ll be interesting to see if any adjustments are made to Twitch Partner Plus before it rolls out in October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKOnmaN6tcPIrZqhZaCWv7W6xKtkqaSlqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
