The show and its spinoffs center around groups of street racers engaging in high-stakes, sometimes life-threatening races all over the United States — and due to the treacherous nature of the show's content, several of the show's racers have previously found themselves involved in crashes, including No Prep Kings <a href=#>star Lizzy Musi</a>.</p><p>No Prep Kings is a Street Outlaws spinoff that is, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the official website</a>, even more dangerous than ever: "No Prep means that nothing has been done to the track to help the drivers out. These roads are rough and untested." Driver Lizzy Musi made a name for herself on the spinoff series, growing a dedicated fanbase and becoming one of the franchise's most beloved names.</p><p>After news broke that Lizzy had passed away at just 33 years old, her fans want to know more about what happened. Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram/@lizzymusi</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What was 'Street Outlaws' star Lizzy Musi's cause of death?</h2><p>In a post Facebook made late on June 27, 2024, Lizzy's father, <a href=#>Pat Musi</a>, confirmed her passing: "Surrounded by her family, in the comfort of her own home, Lizzy was called to heaven at 11:25 p.m. tonight."</p><p>"Thank you for all the prayers and support throughout her battle. At this time, the family would like to have time to process, [grieve], and make arrangements in peace. We will give an update as soon as we have information to share," he continued.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This news comes after Lizzy announced her cancer diagnosis in April 2023 on Instagram.</h2><p>"A few days ago I have been diagnosed with Triple Negative Stage 4 breast cancer that has moved to my lymph nodes to my liver," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared</a>. "I have a rough journey ahead of me. I appreciate everyone’s messages and calls." Though no official cause of death has been made public, it is believed that her passing was related to her struggle with breast cancer.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Lizzy's fans have taken to her social media page to express their sadness and share condolences with her loved ones.</p><p>"RIP to a legend! You’ll be missed," one fan said.</p><p>"Such a huge loss in the racing community ... so sorry, Pat, to hear about this. F--k cancer," another commented.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Lizzy's family, friends, and fans at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSloaqvxm651KygZqukp7KmwIyorK2kkazA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
