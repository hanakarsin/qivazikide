He made some comments about getting his booty eaten and some negative things about Beyonc√© and Jay-Z. Now he's trending on Twitter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's always a good idea to watch what you say. Even if you didn't say something online, it could easily end up on the internet and start a lot of conversation. Rapper <a href=#>Trick Daddy</a> has learned that the hard way more than once. It's gotten him into some hot water a few times.</p><p>In June 2021, Trick made some less than favorable remarks about <a href=#>Beyonc√©</a> and her husband <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>. The couple's fans weren't having it and called him out on social media. What exactly did Trick Daddy say? Strop on your seatbelts as we get you up to speed ‚Äî because it's a lot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trick Daddy recently said he likes to have his booty eaten in the bedroom.</h2><p>In an August 2021 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drink Champs</a>, Trick Daddy revealed what he's interested in behind closed doors. He likes to get his booty eaten and isn't ashamed to say it. "I get ate out," he said. And when asked if he has his legs up in the air he responded, "It depends."</p><p>But this isn't the first time Trick has been open with his booty-related activities. A few years back, he sold some "Eat a Booty Gang" t-shirts and said Aug. 5, 2014, is "National Eat a Booty Day," according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot 97</a>. Although he hasn't said much about it since then. But fans have had a lot to say about it on Twitter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If anyone is wondering why Trick Daddy is trending‚Ä¶ üò≥üòê<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Li0WJwhInW</a></p>‚Äî XXL Magazine (@XXL) <a href=#>August 31, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These comments made Trick Daddy trend on Twitter.</h2><p>As usual, Twitter has taken to trolling Trick for what he's said. There are tons of memes and jokes about him all over the internet. Some are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">calling him gay</a> even though he's only spoken about having sex with women.</p><p>For now, Trick hasn't responded to all of the comments online, but considering that this really isn't a secret, it's not likely that he will. If anything, this would be the best time for him to drop a mixtape. Maybe we'll hear about a new project in the coming days.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trick Daddy üíÄ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UFWwtrvHY5</a></p>‚Äî Brittanie (@ItsBriittaniiee) <a href=#>August 31, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trick Daddy also said that he doesn‚Äôt believe that Beyonc√© can sing, and social media went nuts.</h2><p>There‚Äôs no denying that Jay-Z and <a href=#>Beyonc√©</a> are the cr√®me de la cr√®me of the music industry. Not only has the power couple made major contributions to music, but they have also used their respective platforms to contribute toward social injustice. This power couple is in a league of their own.</p><p>Time and time again, social media has proved you can‚Äôt come for Queen Bey and make it out unscathed. But for some reason, Trick Daddy felt that he could.</p><p>In a recent Clubhouse chat, the Miami native, whose real name is Maurice Samuel Young, shared his thoughts and feelings about Beyonc√©‚Äôs talent.</p><p>‚ÄúBeyonc√© f--k with her because she sees money,‚Äù Trick said on Clubhouse. ‚ÄúBeyonc√© ain‚Äôt trying to give back to music or nothing. Beyonc√© doesn't write music and barely can sing her motherf--king self. Beyonc√© can‚Äôt sing.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When Trick Daddy says Beyonc√© can‚Äôt sing‚Ä¶THIS Beyonc√©? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DMEWIxBxYa</a></p>‚Äî Kari Mtz (@kmarti50) <a href=#>June 22, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>And Trick didn‚Äôt stop there. The rapper added that his opinion is supported with first-hand experience of being around the ‚ÄúBrown Skin Girl‚Äù songstress.</p><p>Apparently, the rapper claims that his godmother trained the star throughout her career, and he doesn't understand why people think she can sing. Whew chile!</p><p>As you would expect, social media was in uproar after his opinion went viral. The Beyhive quickly shared their criticism of Trick‚Äôs opinion. Fans posted videos of Beyonc√© singing a capella as proof of her talent, while others simply dismissed his claims.</p><p>Other Beyhive members also claim that he is mentioning Beyonc√©‚Äôs name to get attention. Either way, the Beyhive was not having it, and they have been dragging Trick ever since.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trick Daddy was on Clubhouse saying Beyonc√© can‚Äôt sing.</p><p>The Beyhive found his cell number üêù <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1Atabgifmw</a></p>‚Äî chris evans (@chris_notcapn) <a href=#>June 22, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trick Daddy also threw shade at Jay-Z and claims that the Brooklyn MC will "never be the greatest rapper alive."</h2><p>If you ask us, Trick is on a career suicide mission. Not only did the rapper come for Beyonc√©, but also threw some shade Jay-Z‚Äôs way.</p><p>In the Clubhouse chat, Trick questioned who put Jay-Z on a legendary level in the rap game.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to give an unpopular opinion right now: Beyonc√© is to R&B what Jay-Z is to New York,‚Äù Trick said on Clubhouse. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they are together. Jay-Z ain‚Äôt never won the greatest rapper alive. Whoever put him on a level like that?‚Äù</p><p>Trick further claimed that Jay-Z changed his name several times to buy DMX's songs, who, according to Trick had <a href=#>outsold Jay-Z</a> a number of times.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If you‚Äôre an avid hip-hop fan, then you likely believe that Jay-Z is one of the greats. It‚Äôs a popular opinion that has yet to be disputed with a tangible argument. And while Jay-Z is one to never speak on such trivial issues, his career, discography, and loyal fan base is proof that he holds major weight in the music game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lpKe2pLeMnZidnKliwKLF</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
