One of the stories that the show follows includes 31-year-old Salomé Jackson. Salomé is an up-and-coming artist, singer, and television personality.</p><p>In 2019 she joined the <a href=#>Cartel Crew</a> in a supporting role and has been promoted to a starring role on Season 3, which premieres on June 14. Previously, Salomé appeared in Season 5 of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.

Fans have been wanting to know since she joined the show who her father is. Keep reading to find out what we know about the VH1 personality's dad.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Cartel Crew' star Salomé Jackson's father is connected with the Cali cartel.</h2><p>Salomé's father is associated with the Cali cartel. Supposedly the Cali cartel was based in Southern Columbia and run by brothers Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. It's alleged that the Cali cartel and Pablo Escobar cooperated to some extent in the 1980s and organized an armed group to stabilize the drug market in the United States. The Medellin cartel took Miami and South Florida.</p><p>The Cali cartel controlled parts of the northeast, including New York City. When Salomé was 5 years old, her home was raided by police, and her father was arrested. Over the years, her family lived on the run between New York and Texas, and because of her father's involvement with the cartel, Salomé went to five elementary and seven different high schools.</p><p>At the age of 18, Salomé escaped from the cartel lifestyle and moved to Atlanta to pursue her career in music.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Salomé (@idreambettyidol)</a></p></figure><p>However, after her father and brother were arrested, she dropped everything to move back to New York. She later decided to move to Florida, hoping to get a fresh start.</p><p>Though she tried to leave the life of drugs and crime behind, her father was transferred to a prison in Miami, bringing her entire past life right to the forefront. We don't know much else about who Salomé's father is and his life of crime, but we do know that the two are still close.</p><p>On her father's birthday this year, she took to social media to post a photo of him, and wrote, "Happy Birthdayyyyy Deddy! I love youuuuuu with all of my heart. I’m so thankful God blessed me with you." Maybe viewers will learn more about him this season on Cartel Crew now that she has a bigger role on the show.</p><p>New episodes of Cartel Crew airs on Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on VH1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6tu8yeZJyZoqmyrXnCq5ywZZaWwamx0Q%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
