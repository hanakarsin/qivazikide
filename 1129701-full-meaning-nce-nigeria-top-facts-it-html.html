It is a qualification required for all teachers in Nigeria, but many working teachers are yet to obtain this qualification.</p><h2>How can I get NCE in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>You can obtain this qualification by enrolling for an NCE course in your preferred institution. You will be awarded the certificate after completing it.</p><h2>Is NCE better than ND?</h2><p class=align-left>It is challenging to determine if NCE is better than ND because the answer depends on your passion. You can pursue a national diploma (ND) in any field of interest, while the latter is particularly for teachers.</p><h2>Is NCE equivalent to HND?</h2><p class=align-left>No, the two are not equivalent. The NCE is a qualification for teachers, while a national higher diploma (HND) is an upgrade on a national diploma for polytechnic graduates.</p><p class=align-left>In modern-day Nigeria, all teachers need the NCE qualification. If your dream career is teaching, you should pursue this qualification after completing your secondary education.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/176f53e01f8d8d06.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Important facts to know about application and registration on the NDA portal</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>List of computer professional bodies in Nigeria and their functions</a></p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published a list of <a href=#>computer professional bodies</a> in Nigeria and their roles.
