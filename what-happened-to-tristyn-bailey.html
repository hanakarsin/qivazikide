She had been repeatedly stabbed and slashed, with an autopsy report revealing 114 wounds, 49 of which were defensive. Her body was found on Mother's Day.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida Times-Union</a>, Aiden lived near Tristyn and attended the same school. Aiden's classmates told police that he'd often talked about his desire to lead a random person out into the woods to stab them. His girlfriend also said he'd had a fascination with knives and had heard voices in his head when angry. Aiden was also said to be on antidepressants.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Bailey 7 (@tristynbaileystrong)</a></p></figure><p>Video footage from the night of Tristyn's murder appears to show her walking with Aiden outside near the area where her body would later be discovered. Apparently Aiden had asked friends earlier that night for Tristyn's phone number, and Aiden convinced Tristyn to come hang out at a friend's house.</p><p>Aiden initially denied any involvement in what happened to Tristyn. He even posted a Snapchat selfie from the back of a police car with the message, "Hey guys has inybody [sic] seen Tristyn lately."</p><p>But police discovered a plethora of evidence against Aiden, including the video footage, DNA, blood on his jeans and in his sink, and a buck knife that belonged to him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Bailey 7 (@tristynbaileystrong)</a></p></figure><p>He was arrested for Tristyn's murder, and was later charged (as an adult) with first degree murder, premeditated.
