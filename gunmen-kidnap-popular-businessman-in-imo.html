They then dragged him out of his car, shoved him into theirs, and sped off to an unidentified location. They arrived in two cars.</p><p>“The kidnappers have not yet made contact with the family members. We hope that the kidnappers will spare his life and let him return home unharmed.”</p><p>Confirming the incident, the Imo Police Spokesman, Henry Okoye, said a distress call was received from an eyewitness at the popular Ikenegbu Layout and rushed to the scene but the unknown gunmen had already escaped.</p><p>Okoye said, “Operatives of the anti-kidnapping squad were swiftly marshaled to the scene. But unfortunately, the hoodlums had already escaped with the unsuspecting victim, highly suspected to be one John Ugorji ‘m’ before the arrival of police operatives, a vehicle suspected to be that of the victim was recovered at the station.</p><p>“The victim’s family is yet to make an official report to the police.
