With this action, the Police Force has retained experienced professionals that would contribute towards sustaining the relative peace of the country.</p><p>“The criteria for the appointment of the new AIGs were purely on merit, professional conduct, and individual performance, urging the newly appointed AIGs to redouble their efforts to curb insecurity.”</p><p>The minister reiterated that President Buhari has directed the Salaries and Wages Commission to come out with a new salary structure.</p><p>He said:&nbsp; “To whom much is given, much is expected.
