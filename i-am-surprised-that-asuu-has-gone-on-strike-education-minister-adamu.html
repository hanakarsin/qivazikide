They submitted a draft agreement which the ministry is looking at,” Adamu said.</p><p>The Minister also denied allegations that he doesn’t attend negotiation meetings with ASUU, stating that the only times he was absent was during his medical trip to Germany.</p><p>He added that the government wants a peaceful and quick resolution to the matter.</p><p>“ASUU will never say that. I always call the meetings myself. The meetings I didn’t attend were those that happened when I was in hospital in Germany.</p><p>“We want a peaceful resolution. The Federal Government is ready to meet them on all issues they have raised. If there are so many meetings and the gap is not closing, then I think it’s not the fault of the government.</p><p>“There is a solution to this. The negotiations are the solution. That is why I have said that I am surprised that ASUU has gone on strike,” Adamu said.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls ASUU on Monday, 14th February declared <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>a one-month warning strike</a></strong> over claims that the federal government has refused to implement the agreement with its members.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BwZqJlkaJ6tMHRqamiq5WZerW0wK1kmqulqnqprdJmnqimlWK8r3nSramio5VisqXBwpqroqeeYrqqusisq56qXZaxornUaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
