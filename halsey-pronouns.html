And there have been some celebrities who have led the way in taking a stance in sharing to the public how they want to be recognized. One of those people is <a href=#>Halsey</a>, who has recently opened up about how she would like to be known whenever anyone talks about or refers to her.</p><p>The singer didn't exactly make this grand announcement about how she'd like to be labeled (if one were to not just use her first name), but she definitely did make it known and her fans have had nothing but good things to say about it. Read more about Halsey's pronouns and what they mean ahead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What are Halsey's pronouns?</h2><p>Fans recently noticed that Halsey had changed up her social media bios, and had updated her pronouns. The singer added "(she/they)." Halsey didn't publicly address the news or give details as to why she decided to add this information, but her supporters have been praising the star for this action.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>People on Twitter have been giving shoutouts to the performer and some have even been thanking her for giving them the courage to state their pronouns. See the outpouring of caring feedback she got:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>halsey changing their pronouns made me confident enough to open up about my pronouns to my parents ü•∫ i'm so proud of her i love them so much pls</p>‚Äî nienke (@habitbIud) <a href=#>March 14, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Halsey changed pronouns, i'm so happy and proud of them &lt;333</p>‚Äî ùñëùñéùñòùñÜ (@hiddencolors_) <a href=#>March 13, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well Halsey gave me the confidence to change my pronouns too sooo check location ‚úåüèΩ</p>‚Äî Moonüêâ | WEarp spoilers (@Blvmoonlight) <a href=#>March 14, 2021</a></figure><p>Halsey has also been very honest and vulnerable about other parts of her life involving self-identification. One of them being her sexuality. In the past few years, she has talked about how she is bisexual and how she wants to be a better advocate for the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>"I spent the past year and the year before that working really hard to be a better representative of the LGBT community," she said in a video message during the 2018 GLAAD Media Awards where she was honored the Outstanding Music Artist title. She also went more in-depth about how she felt coming out as bisexual.</p><p>She added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a young, bisexual woman, and I‚Äôve spent a large part of my life trying to validate myself ‚Äî to my friends, to my family, to myself ‚Äî trying to prove that who I love and how I feel is not a phase; it‚Äôs not part of some confusion that‚Äôs going to change or could be manipulated." Halsey also mentioned that she had really been thoughtful about weaving in female pronouns into her music more.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>And in February 2021, she shared her thoughts on womanhood and how experiencing pregnancy has enlightened her about how she views gender.&nbsp;</p><p>"I‚Äôve been thinking lots about my body. it‚Äôs strange to watch yourself change so quickly. I thought pregnancy would give me very strong, binary feelings about ‚Äúwomanhood‚Äù but truly it has leveled my perception of gender entirely. My sensitivity to my body has made me hyper aware of my humanness and that‚Äôs all. Doing a remarkable thing," she said in an IG post.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by halsey (@iamhalsey)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What do she / they pronouns mean?</h2><p>Pronouns are used as a substitution over a noun or a noun phrase. For example, if you're talking about someone and you're not using their name to identify them, you're probably using a pronoun in replacement. But many people don't just go by a pronoun just based on how they might appear on the outside. The point being, it's not a good idea to assume a person's pronoun because they look a certain way to you.</p><p>So, when Halsey says she identifies as "she / they" it means that she identifies as not only a woman, but also as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">non-binary</a>. Non-binary might mean something different to many sorts of people, but the foundation of its multifaceted definition is that it's used to describe someone who doesn't feel like they fit in the male or female identity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6tv8SyZKmqn6O8trrS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
