It accelerates the aging process by producing wrinkles, sun spots, and blotchy, red-ish skin, which is why most women slather their faces in SPF lotions before leaving the house. But while women, especially celebrities, are burdened with the impossible task of looking 20-something forever, male stars are gladly basking in the sun without a care in the world. It appears celebrity men are free to age as they please, strutting down the red carpet with leathery, sun-scorched skin that rivals Tan Mom. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember her?</a> It honestly boggles the mind. Here's why Hollywood's aging men could benefit from a little sunscreen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Sean Penn</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Pictures, Getty Images</span></figure><p>Sean, 58, clearly loves the sun. Too bad the sun hates him. The picture on the right has not been doctored. He’s really that red in real life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Arnold Schwarzenegger</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Carolco Pictures, Getty Images</span></figure><p>Arnold, 71, was clearly enjoying all that California sunshine while he was governor. Fortunately for him, those sun spots can be terminated with skin treatments.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. Steven Seagal</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros., Getty Images</span></figure><p>The 66-year-old action movie star clearly hasn't even heard of sunscreen. Considering he's recently been under fire for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations against him</a>, maybe this is just nature's way of punishing him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. George Hamilton</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>George Hamilton, 79, used to be the George Clooney of the 60s, but these days he's more Oompa Loompa than Casanova.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. Mickey Rourke</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Galactic Films , Getty Images</span></figure><p>Micky, 66, doesn't need to be reminded that he looks awful. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He knows</a>. He's spent years trying to fix his botched plastic surgeries. Although if he wanted to rewind the hands of time, he should've just stayed out of the sun.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. Sylvester Stallone</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MGM, Getty Images</span></figure><p>Sylvester, 71, is so over-tanned these days, it's easy to forget how darn pale he was in the first Rocky movie. Considering he cares enough about his looks to get alleged plastic surgery, you'd think he'd care enough to wear sunscreen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7. Dolph Lundgren</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MGM, Getty Images</span></figure><p>And speaking of Rocky, remember him? He played the big, scary Russian in Rocky IV. At 60 years old, he's actually aged pretty well, but he clearly loves that LA sun.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8. Al Pacino</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Pictures, Getty Images</span></figure><p>At 78 years old and one of the most iconic actors of all time, Al probably thinks he doesn't need sunscreen. After all, that leathery skin really came in handy when he played Satan in The Devil's Advocate.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9. Leonardo Dicaprio</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bazmark Films, Getty Images</span></figure><p>Leo’s days of hanging around on yachts with 21-year-old models is clearly taking a toll on his face. At 43, his skin shouldn’t look like this already.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">10. Mel Gibson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Mel, 62, has always had a flushed color to his face. However, his refusal to protect his skin from the sun has resulted in rough, dry skin that adds a good 10 years to his face.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">11. Robert Redford</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Robert was like the Brad Pitt of the 60s, and considering he's 83, we should all probably give him a little slack. Obviously he's not going to have butter smooth skin at his age, but the significant sun damage he has is undeniable.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">12. Clint Eastwood</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Universal Pictures, Getty Images</span></figure><p>Same goes for Clint, for that matter. He spent most of his career standing in the hot desert while shooting Western movies, and it definitely shows on his face. But hey, at least he still looks better than Sean Penn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZqaF9lfnC5t5KIsWeTmrmmrtGiq7JlnZq7bq3GoqWg</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
