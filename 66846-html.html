And the answers we have received is inadequate,"</i>&nbsp;Ezekwesili said. <i>"Please let Mr. President know that the answers we received is not enough. Tell him also that he also missed a colossal opportunity to address his citizens on a crucial issue. "Our proposal is: that we will demand of Mr. President another opportunity of addressing the issues that the citizens have put before him as the commander-in-chief.</i> <i>"We also want the delegates to tell the president that we hold the office of the president in very high esteem,"</i> she added.</p><p>No protest group had ever marched on Aso Rock before.
