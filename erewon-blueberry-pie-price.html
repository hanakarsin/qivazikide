Don’t believe me? Keep reading to see how much the renowned dessert costs at the woman’s local grocery store!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">An Erewhon shopper shared the ridiculous price for a slice of the store’s blueberry pie.</h2><p>For many of us, going to the grocery store and NOT grabbing a dessert that was coincidentally left off the grocery list is nearly impossible, however, after seeing the price of just one piece of an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erewhon blueberry pie</a>.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, Erewhon is a natural foods market with multiple locations nationwide, including Los Angeles County, Calif. During a Thanksgiving shopping run to one of the market’s LA locations, a TikTok user named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara (@saraandcrew)</a> highlighted Erewhon’s exorbitant prices.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by EREWHON (@erewhonmarket)</a></p></figure><p>In Sara’s TikTok, she writes, “Guess the price of this blueberry pie slice at Erewhon,” a clear sign the price wasn’t the average $5-10 for a pie slice. As Cardi B’s “Bongos” plays over the video, Sara scans through Erewhon’s bakery aisle. She then picks up a slice and shows the pie slice is worth $42.</p><p>Yes, you read that correctly. A standalone, albeit massive pie slice, is no cheaper than a Grubhub order. And no, that’s not counting delivery fees!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@saraandcrew href=#>@saraandcrew</a><p>guess the price: erewhon edition 😇 let me know if you were correct 💖🤭 <a title=thanksgiving href=#>#thanksgiving</a> <a title=erewhon href=#>#erewhon</a> <a title=erewhonhaul href=#>#erewhonhaul</a> <a title=guesstheprice href=#>#guesstheprice</a></p><a title="♬ Bongos (feat.

Megan Thee Stallion) - Cardi B</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sara’s TikTok commenters’ guesses on the price of the blueberry pie were utterly inaccurate.</h2><p>When Sara asked those watching her video to “guess” the price of a blueberry pie at Erewhon, I guessed so as not to feel left out. Now, I’ve never been great at guessing games, but I could’ve never imagined a slice of pie, not a whole one, was worth more than $15 tops. Apparently, I was disgustingly wrong, as the pie is almost triple my estimate.</p><p>The price of the Erewhon pie is likely because the company describes itself as a “Certified Organic Retailer” and, hopefully, produces fresh fruits to use in its pies. Still, those looking to add more organic foods to their diet, even in dessert form, shouldn’t have to pay almost half of $100 to do so.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@saraandcrew</a></figure><p>Underneath the video, Sara asked her community to “guess the price: Erewhon edition” and to “let me know if you were correct.” Unsurprisingly, no one in the comment section guessed the correct price, but nearly everyone was in disbelief by the cost of the pie slice.</p><p>“I thought it would be 20 or 25. Why is it 42? Someone who works at Erewhon should talk about working there,” one user wrote, to which another commenter assumed, “I feel like Erewhon workers sign NDAs 'cause I never hear them speak out about this stuff lol.”</p><p>“I said $14, thinking that would be the absolute max even Erewhon would do 😳,” said a user.</p><p>“My guess was so confident, and it was $9.99 😂,” a fourth commenter said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@saraandcrew</a></figure><p>While one user said Erewhon possibly makes its employees sign NDAs, one brave employee at the company’s Santa Monica store commented that a fellow employee may have tagged the price incorrectly. I definitely hope that’s the case, but I still know where not to get my pie in LA!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmr%2Bmw86nZJukpZqvpr7RsmSpoZVivbO1wp4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
