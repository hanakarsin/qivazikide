He was so incensed at the decision, that for two months he refused to take his punishment, insisting that he’d done nothing wrong.</p><p>But eventually, Allegri calmly showed who was boss – and Ronaldo’s team-mates all ended up with new iMac computers.</p><p>Szczesny told Polish talk show <strong>Prosto w Szczene</strong>: “Yes, we all have an iMac.</p><p>“It took a very long time because he couldn’t process that red card and insisted high and low that he was not doing anything wrong.</p><p>“It took him a bit, about two months of arguing, but we all have received an iMac.”</p><p>However, Szczesny said Ronaldo wasn’t the only one to fall foul of Allegri’s punishment system.</p><p>The goalie revealed that he’d also been forced to fork out on presents for his team-mates, after being late for training.</p><p>He explained: “I thought it was Tuesday, but it turned out to be Wednesday that day.</p><p>“Allegri called me and said everyone was already there. When I arrived half an hour late on the training field, everyone said: ‘oh, we’re getting presents!’ I ended up buying headphones for the boys.”</p><p>The 29-year-old bought all of his team-mates Dr. Dre Beats headphones as an apology for being late.</p><p>Disciplinarian Allegri departed the club at the end of that campaign and Maurizio Sarri took charge at the Allianz Stadium in June 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5BrZpyqmajBqq3NqGSrp56WuaW7jJussqtdmru1tdGeZKOtppq7tcHSZqqqrZGZeqq5wJyqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
