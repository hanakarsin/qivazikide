His birth name was Andre Romelle Young. His parents were Theodore and Verna Young who got married in 1964. They decided to give him the name Romelle after his father’s amateur R7B group called The Romells. However, in 1972, his parents got divorced. Theodore moved on and eventually got remarried to Curtis Crayon. Theodore and Crayon had three children who are the late Jerome and Tyree, and a daughter called Shameka.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1cbbedff7781e0fd.jpg><p class=align-left>In 1976, he enrolled in the Vanguard Junior High School. The school was in an area prone to so much gun violence. Young, therefore, filed for a transfer from Vanguard Junior High School to the suburban Roosevelt Junior High School. During this period, his mother got remarried to Warren Griffin with whom she got four more kids. It meant that Young had acquired three more stepsisters and one more step brother called Warren G.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0904f61708ead7d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>600Breezy biography: age, height, real name, kids, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Later in 1979, he attended Centennial High School in Compton, but then transferred to Fremont High School in South Central Los Angeles because of his poor grades. He decided to try his luck and enrol in an apprenticeship program at the Northrop Aviation Company. However, given his poor grades, Young was unsuitable for the program. Due to all the changes in his family and school life, he found music as his only solace. Therefore, in the last of his high school years, he concentrated more on his social and entertainment experience.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Ryan Destiny bio: age, height, ethnicity, parents, boyfriend, net worth</p><h2>How old is Young?</h2><p class=align-left>Andre was born on the 18th of February in 1965.

Here is a list of Dr Dre kids:</p><h3>Curtis Young Dr. Dre son</h3><p class=align-left>Curtis is the first born of Young. He was born on the 15th of December in 1981. His mother is Cassandra Joy Greene. However, he was not brought up by his biological father, Romelle. Instead, he grew up with his mother and stepfather.

It is because he also ventured into music, and especially rapping.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/19af61b956253273.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Find out the most interesting facts about Cash Warren, Jessica Alba's husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Given that most rappers have rapping names that they usually want their fans to remember and acknowledge easily, Curtis also acquired a new name for himself.
