Emily (<a href=#>Aubrey Plaza</a>) has been doing everything she can to make an honest living, but her minor criminal record is seriously inhibiting her job search. What's a girl to do except turn to organized crime? Student debt won't pay itself off, after all. Emily starts working for <a href=#>Youcef</a> (Theo Rossi), a financial fraud mastermind.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As Emily finds herself ensconced in the criminal underworld of financial scams, she finds herself taking care of her friend Liz's (Megalyn Echikunwoke) cute little dachshund.</p><p>Liz tells Emily that he's (the dog's name is never actually mentioned, sadly) in crate training. Naturally, Emily lets Liz's dog out after he keeps barking throughout the night. However, Emily puts her friend's dog in danger when a deal goes awry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does the dog die in 'Emily the Criminal'? (SPOILER)</h2><p>Liz's dog is just minding his own business in his crate at Emily's apartment when the poor little pup is dog-napped. Why? A client stops by Emily's apartment, informing Emily that they're there to pick up a stolen Samsung.</p><p>However, the client pins Emily down and threatens to cut her throat if she doesn't give up the code to her save. The client and his lady partner in crime take off with all of Emily's earnings ... and Liz's dog.</p><p>The two take off, leaving Emily alone with her immense guilt, now lacking her money and her best friend's dog. Naturally Emily collects herself, has an "Oh hell no" moment, and grabs a taser.</p><p>Turns out the two criminals who attacked Emily didn't have the wherewithal to drive off the second they got their spoils. Emily seizes the moment and grabs the woman and pins her to the ground. She figures out her address and threatens her with that knowledge.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But seriously, is the dog OK? (SPOILERS)</h2><p>Seriously, who kidnaps a dog with no remorse? Thankfully, Emily manages to save Liz's cute dachshund from the back of the other criminal's truck, and her money.</p><p>Naturally, Emily does not mention this whole encounter to Liz when her best friend returns from her trip to Portugal.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a way, Liz's dog being trapped in his crate the whole time was quite symbolic of Emily's journey in Emily the Criminal. After all, she's trapped in the crate of financial debt, struggling to escape so she can follow her travel and career dreams. However, the only way she can escape her own proverbial crate is by saving herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Emily does eventually save herself by the end of Emily the Criminal, but in a way that's rather unexpected.
