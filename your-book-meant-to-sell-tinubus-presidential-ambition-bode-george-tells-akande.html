Do you think that is not political? Tinubu has thrown his hat into the ring that he wants to contest [for the presidency in 2023], and so he must bring everybody else down and start promoting him.</p><p>“Today is December 20, and in another month, we will be heading into the new year in another week. And that is the year of politics in this country. What an appropriate time to now open up a pandora box, demonising some leaders and elders and the only man you can see and praise is your brother [ Tinubu]. Why did he come and launch the book in Lagos — he has never had anything to do with Lagos — if not to promote Tinubu?”</p><p>Speaking further, George lambasted Akande for launching the book in Lagos, asking why the former APC chairman did not launch the autobiography in Osun state where he was a governor or in Ibadan where he was a former Secretary to the Government of Old Oyo State.</p><p>Recall that George had asked Akande to <strong><a href=#>immediately withdraw his book</a></strong> from circulation and apologize to Yoruba elders dragged in the document.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5FpZrKnpad6o7vOpGSmnZGjwW7AzmaqnqScYsGqutSbrKxloKeytLXDnqWtoZGheqK5waKroqeeYq%2BwsMRmnp6nopyybsDEpaOsZZGgrq%2BwxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
