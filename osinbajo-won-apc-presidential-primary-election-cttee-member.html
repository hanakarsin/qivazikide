He identified problems and preferred solutions to them more than all other aspirants. For someone who has never contested any election before and with no politicking knowledge, to emerge third at the convention, I consider him the greatest winner of the convention.</p><p>“I do not doubt in my mind that Nigeria has lost the best presidential candidate that would have been produced.</p><p>“politics of today, it is very clear that the highest bidders always have their way and the election goes to not necessarily the best, but those who could buy their way in a cash and carry manner.”</p><p>Girei who congratulated Tinubu over his victory promised to work for the overall victory of the APC from bottom to top.</p><p>“As a loyal member of the APC, I will work for the total victory of my party’s flagbearers from bottom to top and I’m confident that our party will emerge victorious in the general election.”</p><p>He added that the Vice Presidential was against vote-buying Girei said “even his friends and associates who tried to help him could only do so without his knowledge or consent.</p><p>“His teaming supporters are those of us who are committed to his ideals out of the conviction that he has the knowledge, experience, capacity, capability, mental and physical fitness, and all that is required to transform our dear nation to greatness.</p><p>“It may also interest Nigerians to know that PYO is opposed to monetisation of our democracy and politics, and has refused to encourage delegate or vote-buying.”</p><p>Speaking on the Muslim/Muslim ticket, he said, “Politics, however, is all about winning strategy, so in my opinion, whatever strategy can be implored to win elections, that is within the confine of the Constitution, to me, it is okay.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5BtZqirmaOvorbOZq6opl2WvaR5z6ucrKGUmru1tcClZKmqmaKus8WMnqOem6SevK95wq2rnp1dorKursSrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
