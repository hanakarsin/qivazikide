In his wisdom, he said the best thing to do for now is to seal off the Assembly until further notice.”</p><p>Also, the lawmaker representing Riyom Constituency in the state assembly, Timothy Dantong said they are aware the order was given by the AIG to curb any crisis situation.</p><p>He added that the Police Chief is expected to mediate between the two factions with a view to getting an amicable resolution.</p><p>He said: “The impression they have is that we are having a crisis. So, they (police) decided to come and seal the Assembly complex.</p><p>“We are aware that the AIG gave the order that none of the factions should come into the Assembly complex for now until everything is sorted out.</p><p>“We are also aware that he is going to mediate in the matter and have a meeting with us to hear the grievances and see if we can resolve the matter before normal plenary will start again to avoid any crisis.</p><p>“We are aware that he has visited Government House but we didn’t see him visiting us. So, we waited and we are still waiting up till this morning (Wednesday) without seeing anybody. All we are saying is that we cannot allow illegality at the Plateau State House of Assembly on who becomes the Speaker.”</p><p>Recall lawmakers in the Plateau State House of Assembly <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>impeached the speaker</a></strong> of the house, Hon.
