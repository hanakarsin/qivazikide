(Though we first fell in love with him as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.)</p><p>The actor’s on-again, off-again relationship with co-star Kristen Stewart made headlines for four years before the pair parted ways for good in May 2013. He then moved on with singer FKA twigs (real name Tahliah Debrett Barnett), but the duo called off their two-year engagement in 2017.</p><p>Since his split from the musician, Robert — who is reportedly set to play Batman —&nbsp;has been linked to two famous blondes, but he only rang in his 33rd birthday on May 13 with one of them. Scroll down for details on the Brit’s recent romance.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Robert Pattinson dating?</h2><p>Robert is currently dating model and actress Suki Waterhouse after a brief dalliance with Mia Wasikowska. The couple, whose relationship became public in July 2018, was spotted celebrating the former teen heartthrob’s birthday at the Chateau Marmont in LA.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Like Robert, Suki has a star-studded dating history. From 2013 to 2015, the now 27-year-old was in a relationship with Bradley Cooper, who’s 17 years her senior. She’s also been linked to Diego Luna, James Marsden, and Richard Madden.&nbsp;</p><p>While most celebrities crave a certain level of privacy when it comes to their personal lives, Robert is notoriously secretive on the subject of his girlfriends. In a recent interview with Sunday Times’ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Style magazine</a>, he explained his need to conceal various aspects of his life.</p><p>"If you let people in, it devalues what love is," he stated. "If a stranger on the street asked you about your relationship, you'd think it extremely rude. If you put up a wall it ends up better."</p><p>The Damsel star continued, "I can't understand how someone can walk down the street holding hands, and it's the same as when I do it and a hundred people are taking your photo. The line between when you're performing and when you're not will eventually get washed away and you'll go completely mad."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Robert with ex-girlfriend Kristen Stewart.</p></figure><p>Despite his commitment to keeping certain details close to his chest, Robert did admit in the interview that he’s on "good terms" with his exes. "They were pretty long relationships," he pointed out, "not like three months."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened between Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs?</h2><p>The duo first began seeing each other in the summer of 2014 and reportedly got engaged less than a year later, though they never publicly confirmed the engagement.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The celebs called it quits two-and-a-half years later with sources stating that the couple’s busy schedules contributed to the split. "He is on a press tour and she is working on her new album. And I think it’s timing," an insider told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> back in October 2017. "They’ve been all over the place. They have not seen each other in probably two months."</p><p>Ironically, FKA twigs has since moved on with Shia LaBeouf, who used to be married to model Mia Goth. Mia and Robert co-starred in the 2018 film High Life, which was released around the same time that their exes started hooking up.&nbsp;</p><p>Hollywood is truly a crazy place.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKunkpq%2FtXnPmqutoZ6ovK95w5qroqaX</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
