Larry passed away peacefully on Feb. 13, 2024, after bravely battling Parkinson's disease for years. He was 80 years old.</p><p>"Larry was a stone-cold world champion at life," reads his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obituary</a>. "He loved with all his heart. He epitomized integrity, kindness, and caring. His was the definition of a life well lived, and it should be celebrated."</p><p>Larry, born on Oct. 20, 1943, graduated from the University of Michigan Business School in 1965. He then entered the family business of scrap metal recycling, starting at Sherwin Metals before moving to Kripke-Tuschman Industries and OmniSource Corporation. In 1993, Larry established Kripke Enterprises alongside his wife, Joanie.</p><p>"Larry built the company with loyalty, love, and genuine concern for his employees, who all remember his wise advice," stated his obituary. "The company continues to thrive, run by his son Matt, nephew Chad Kripke, and many more."</p><p>However, work was just one aspect of Larry's life. According to his obituary, Larry was a total family man and often remarked that "family is everything." He never missed his children's games, plays, or milestones, and he closely followed every development in the lives of his eight grandchildren.</p><p>But as much as Larry cherished his children, grandchildren, parents, siblings, cousins, and friends, his "one true love" was his wife Joanie. They first met at the University of Michigan when he was 19 and she was 17, and they were together for nearly 60 years. "Through thick and thin," they stuck together, raised a family, and "instilled in their children Midwestern values of hard work, dependability, loyalty and of course, family above all."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKWZoqfGbrfRoqeknV2ptaZ5waiwrGWjmq60u81maw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
