So everyone was scared of disobeying their orders; even when I saw the opportunity to run”.</p><p>“We were driven on many trucks for hours to a point where we were told to go down the trucks; it was at that point, after I observed that the men that abducted us were not paying attention to us that I whispered to some of us to run, but many were scared because of the earlier warning; I was terrified as well&nbsp; but I and one other girl, summoned courage and snuck out and we began to run. We ran for hours until we got to where we saw people we could trust who later assisted us to get to Chibok”.</p><p>Sarah who called on the federal government to ensure the rescue of the other girls said: “Everyday I wake up with the hope that my friends would be rescued; everyday we keep looking towards the direction of the road leading into Chibok to see if the girls would be brought in; but everyday our hopes are dampened when the night comes and none of them come home.</p><p>The federal government and our soldiers must do everything to rescue them because I am always scared each time I remember the girls are with those men; they don’t look kind or gentle, they are not nice people to be with; I fear they don’t harm them.”</p><p><a href=#><u>Just few days ago another escaped victim, Godiya Simon also narrated her ordeal in Sambisa Forest.</u></a></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3eEkG5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
