He has recorded five goals in his last three games.</p><p>However, his current number of goals is still far from the 26 goals and five assists he recorded in 32 league games last season.</p><p>After the 6-1 win over Sassuolo, Napoli coach, Calzona told DAZN that Osimhen wasn’t at his best after the 2023 AFCON but he is gradually rediscovering his form.</p><p>“Victor is returning to his levels. Clearly, he wasn’t in great shape after the Africa Cup of Nations, he was away for over a month and is slowly rediscovering his form,” the coach said.</p><p>“Kara also struggled, but today showed just what he can do.”</p><p>He added, “I sensed positivity from the first training session, the lads always gave me their all. I was surprised to see how eager they were to work, to stay together, and that gave me hope.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FyZq%2Bhk6m8s3nOrKCmoJWjeqq%2FjKucnaGjmLy3sdGipaBlmJ7AbrLOq6RmppGlvK21jJymmpuYYsCixdJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
