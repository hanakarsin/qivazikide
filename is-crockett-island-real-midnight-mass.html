Technically no, but you can visit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Netflix is known for being a streaming platform that also knocks original content out of the park. The latest is <a href=#>Midnight Mass</a>, a horror series that takes viewers on a scary adventure that takes place on an island. But <a href=#>is Crockett Island real</a>?</p><p>Midnight Mass isn’t like a typical horror show. It’s the latest title in a slew of scary series from director-writer Mike Flanagan. His previous works include other horror shows that quickly grew popular including The Haunting of Bly Manor and The Haunting of Hill House, based on the horror novels by Henry James and Shirley Jackson.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Unlike some of Mike’s previous haunted series, this one centers on an isolated island community that experiences miraculous events — and frightening omens — after the arrival of a charismatic, mysterious priest.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And it’s left fans with one big question: Is Crockett Island on ‘Midnight Mass’ real?</h2><p>The island is what brings to life so much of the scary moments in the Netflix show and for anyone wondering if it’s real, technically it’s not. However, you can still visit. Crockett Island as we’ve seen in Midnight Mass is not a real place.</p><p>But the fictional island is a real location — it just goes by a different name. Unlike Mike’s The Haunting of Bly Manor, which was mostly computer-generated, Crockett Island is a real filming location.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Midnight Mass is filmed in Richmond, British Columbia, in Canada. The real name is Garry Point Park, and it makes a very convincing creepy island for Crockett Island. The park is beautiful and a whole lot less scary in real life.</p><p>“The unique rolling and open landscape Garry Point Park includes the Kuno Garden, a Japanese style memorial garden, beached logs and beach access, expansive open areas for picnicking and kite flying and power kiting, interpretive signage and the Fisherman's Memorial Needle on the south side of the park,” the website for the park reads.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>“Additional heritage aspects in the park include a heritage moorage facility with buildings and docks at historic Scotch Pond located on the north side of the park.”</p><p>It would be hard to pick out the real filming location for Midnight Mass because the production crew went an extra mile to make the beautiful landscape look a lot creepier. The production team built a village in Garry Point Park, which was used for the location scenes in the horror show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>That's a wrap on MIDNIGHT MASS. It has been an extraordinary, unprecedented production, and I cannot be prouder of this amazing cast and crew. In fact - and I do not say this lightly - this has been the best production experience of my career.</p>— Mike Flanagan (@flanaganfilm) <a href=#>December 16, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>“Kate [Siegel] and I were the last Americans from the show to leave Vancouver, and from the airplane window, I could see our sets standing at Garry Point Park,” Mike shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> in December 2020. “They’d remain standing for months, at the mercy of the elements, and we had no idea when or if we’d be able to return.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, the show is also partially shot at a studio in the area, The Bridge Studios in Vancouver, which is the same studio where some scenes in The Haunting of Bly Manner were filmed, too.</p><p>Midnight Mass is currently streaming on Netflix</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur9GomqSdpKl6qr%2FLmqWdZaKarq15zKKbp6GXncFuucCsqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
