Mazi Udubuan Sage Chubueze is only a member of IPOB.</p><p>“He is not one of the ESN operatives let alone being a top commander of ESN. What transpired was that he came to his home in Ekwulobia, Aguata LGA to bury his dead mother and soldiers acting on a tip-off from a traitor stormed his house. Yes, he is an IPOB member but not ESN Commander. But those who sabotaged him shall reap the reward of treachery.</p><p>“We want to make it categorically clear to all and sundry that ESN does not go with army uniforms or police because we are different people. Again ESN has nothing to do with pump-action rifles.</p><p>“The claims by the Army that he has bullet wounds are all lies. We call for a forensic examination to deflate this lie. It was the Army that shot him in his compound and claimed he had bullet wounds.</p><p>“We once again call on the United Nations not to give a blind eye to the atrocities going on in Nigeria. The world should hold Nigeria accountable for all the inhuman treatments.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5JqZqKon5d6pbHNopysZZGnv6a%2F02amn2WVqLtur86mpJqmlJq%2FbrXNZpinmZ2Xv6J7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
