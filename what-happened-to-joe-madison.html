Recently, Joe's fans might have noticed that he's no longer broadcasting every day the way he once did.</p><p>Following the revelation that Joe isn't on the air, many of his most dedicated fans wondered what had happened to him. Joe announced in December 2023 that he would be stepping away from his show. Many fans want to know why and when he might be back on the air.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Joe Madison?</h2><p>On Dec. 20, 2023, Joe announced that his prostate cancer had reemerged and that he would need to take time off from the show as a result.</p><p>“As many listeners are aware, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009," Joe wrote in his statement. "I’ve spoken candidly about my diagnosis to encourage more men to prioritize their health and talk with their healthcare providers about testing and treatments."</p><p>"As Dick Gregory once told me, ‘Don’t let fear get in the way,'" his statement continued. "Thanks to early detection and proton treatment, my cancer went into remission for a long time. Unfortunately, earlier this year the cancer resurfaced."</p><p>Joe explained that he was able to continue doing his show, which runs four hours, despite the reemergence of his cancer, thanks to support from his wife and SiriusXM.</p><p>"However, upon preparing to return from the Thanksgiving hiatus my health took an adverse turn, making it challenging to host a four-hour live show every day," he explained. "Currently, I am taking time to focus on my well-being. During this time, SiriusXM will continue to air ‘Madison Classics’ at our regularly scheduled time."</p><p>Joe thanked his fans for their support and also asked for privacy as he goes through treatment and spends time with his family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans have offered Joe heartfelt support.</h2><p>Following Joe's announcement, fans have been nothing but encouraging, saying that Joe should take all the time he needs.</p><p>"We are sending you prayers of courage and strength as you take time to heal your mind and body," one person wrote. "We love you, sir. Take all the time you need."</p><p>"Thank you for allowing your listeners to know what's going on. I am praying for your health and well-being," another added.</p><p>While it isn't clear when Joe might be back, it seems like fans understand that he needs to focus on his recovery and want him to take as much time as he needs to do that. Our thoughts and prayers are with Joe as he focuses on his health and battles cancer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjp5ViuqKwyKympw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
