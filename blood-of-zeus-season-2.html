However, when he comes face to face with life-threatening events, his real identity is revealed, and he is the son of none other than the king of the gods himself, Zeus.</p><p>From then on, Heron embarks on a life-altering journey. Fans are already abuzz with questions regarding <a href=#>Season 2</a> of Blood of Zeus and when it will appear in their Netflix queue.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‚ÄòBlood of Zeus‚Äô is a unique spin on traditional Greek mythology.</h2><p>In the first season of Blood of Zeus, Heron takes an epic journey where he goes on quests, finds magical weapons, and fights monsters akin to those told in the legendary stories of Greek mythology.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The animated series has an ensemble cast of voice actors, including Derek Phillips as Heron, Jessica Henwick as Alexia, Claudia Christian as Hera, Elias Toufexis as Seraphim, and Jason O‚ÄôMara as Zeus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a Season 2 of ‚ÄòBlood of Zeus‚Äô?</h2><p>Since Blood of Zeus recently dropped on Netflix, typically the popular streaming platform waits to see how the series performs before renewing the series or announcing any sort of plans for more seasons of the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The production company who produced Blood of Zeus struck gold on Netflix before with the hit series, Castlevania, which is already gearing up for a fourth season. Could Blood of Zeus follow in those footsteps? The show is currently boasting a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes so signs point to ‚Äúyes.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúConsidering how incredibly well-made the inaugural season of Blood of Zeus is and the rave reviews it has been receiving, it is only a matter of time before Netflix renews the series,‚Äù <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a> wrote. ‚ÄúOnce that happens, expect Blood of Zeus season 2 to release at some point in late 2021.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 2 of ‚ÄòBlood of Zeus‚Äô could see a new antagonist.</h2><p>Season 1 of Blood of Zeus only gave viewers a taste of Hades, a popular antagonist in Greek mythology. He is introduced late in the season, so there is a possibility that he might be the primary antagonist in Season 2.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Some fans who were onto this theory, however, were disappointed at the predictability. ‚ÄúBlood of Zeus was amazing, they kinda set up Hades to be the main villain in season 2? Maybe? If so I‚Äôll be a bit disappointed but I‚Äôm so glad he wasn‚Äôt involved in this season,‚Äù a fan on Twitter wrote.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Twitter is already begging Netflix for another season of ‚ÄòBlood of Zeus.‚Äô</h2><p>Even though the animated series just dropped on Netflix, fans are already not-so-patiently waiting for a second season of the animated series. Some are even disappointed that the first season is only eight, 30 minute episodes. ‚Äúi want season 2 of Blood of Zeus and i haven't even seen ep 3 yet,‚Äù one fan wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Blood of Zeus on <a href=#>@netflix</a> so good!!!!
