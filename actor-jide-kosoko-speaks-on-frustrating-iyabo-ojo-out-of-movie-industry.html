I personally condemn any act of rape, I only pleaded that the law should be allowed to take its cause.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jide-Kosoko-300x300.jpg alt="Veteran Nollywood Actor, Jide Kosoko 'Turns' Woman, Stir Reactions" width=632 height=632 sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Neither was the conference against<a href=#> Iyabo Ojo’s</a> stand fighting for the minor, what we are saying is that Iyabo Ojo should desist from making derogatory remarks about TAMPAN and the Yoruba movie industry, you cannot because of one person condemn the entire industry. Baba Ijesha will be dealt with by the law,” the father of three said.</p><p>The veteran actor also dissociated TAMPAN from the statement made by actor Olofa Ina at Baba Ijesha’s bail hearing. He said he believes Olofa Ina spoke from a place of emotional pain and that his remark does not reflect the position of TAMPAN. Olofa had claimed that sleeping with people in their industry was a normal thing.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iyabo-ojo-300x284.jpg alt="Nollywood actress Iyabo Ojo" width=436 height=413 sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Reacting to the outburst of actress Nkechi Blessing in how he said he would work to frustrate her out of the industry, the father of three said, he has no power to do such because he is not God.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nkechi-blessing-sunday-300x171.jpg alt width=672 height=383 sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Speaking further, Jide said it was an attempt to soften both actresses whom he considered his children in the industry.
