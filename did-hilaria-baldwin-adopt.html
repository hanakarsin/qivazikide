She and her husband, Alec Baldwin, welcomed Edu — their fifth child together (and Alec's sixth child) — in September of 2020. Now, though, there's a brand-new baby in the house. Another one!</p><p>That's what's confusing people. With only about six months between Edu's birth and the announcement of Baby No. 6 (a daughter named Lucía), people are doing the math and, well, something isn't adding up. So, what's the deal? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Hilaria Baldwin adopt</a> her and Alec's daughter Lucía?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Hilaria Baldwin adopt her daughter Lucía?</h2><p>The public first learned about Lucía's arrival when Hilaria posted a picture of her with all six of her kiddos on Instagram. (She also included the number seven in her caption — most likely a reference to the fact that <a href=#>Alec has seven kids total</a>). Other than that rather cryptic post, there hasn't been too much info about how Lucía came to join the family. Was she adopted? Born via surrogate?</p><p>Some fans have also been pretty rude in demanding answers to their questions, even though — let's face it — it's not really any of our business. After Alec shared the same pic of his wife and kids on Instagram, one commenter couldn't help but ask:&nbsp;</p><p>"Who’s the mother? [Hilaria] wasn’t pregnant. She gave birth six months ago. If it was a surrogate just say that. If the baby was adopted just say that. If the baby was the product of an affair and you’ve decided to raise it with your wife just say that. If you don’t want to say anything – why don’t you both stop constantly posting and begging for clickbait. Just raise [your] 100 children in private."</p><p>Alec (understandably!) didn't like this and commented back, "You should shut the f--k up and mind your own business." And honestly? He's not wrong!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>me trying to figure out how Hilaria Baldwin had a surprise baby five months after giving birth? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/b7GiCpGXqs</a></p>— Katelynn (@katelynnmorgan) <a href=#>March 1, 2021</a></figure><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reached out to Hilaria's rep for clarification about Lucía's birth, they were told, "We’re still not issuing a statement or confirming anything — what [Hilaria] posted stands." Hilaria is usually so open with her family life on social media, but there were no pics or announcements of a new pregnancy since Edu's birth back in September.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hilaria says "very special angels" helped bring Lucía into the world.</h2><p>Hilaria has continued to share adorable photos of Lucía along with her many siblings. In one Instagram post, Hilaria spoke about the grief she and the rest of the family suffered after she had two miscarriages back in 2019 — specifically, the loss of a baby girl which occurred in November of that year.</p><p>"When I found out our baby had died, I told our children that their sister was going to come, just not at that time," Hilaria wrote in her caption. "Nothing will ever replace her, but two wonderful souls have come into our lives, and we are humbled to know them. Our children were brave during our time of tremendous grief—braver than us...and they held out hope."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hilaria Thomas Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin)</a></p></figure><p>Hilaria went on to say, "We are living each day, bonding, and grateful for all of the very special angels who helped bring Lucía into the world." As you can see, there's still no info about who those "special angels" are — the term could refer to a surrogate, birth parents, fertility doctors, or a host of other individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, it doesn't look like we'll find out exactly how Lucía came to join the family. Luckily, we do get to watch her grow up with her siblings and surrounded by love — that's good enough for us!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaleceio5qqmZZ6o63Lna6ipl2WsbC80w%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
