We're so consumed with college loans and poorly paid jobs, most us are stuck renting apartments until we're way into our 30s. However, if you're a celebrity, homeownership is far less elusive. In fact, many famous teens are already real estate moguls by 18 — and a few of them snatched up their first "starter" mansions even before that. Here's a look at all the celebs who owned homes before they were even old enough to drink.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Kylie Jenner</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The youngest Jenner sister was only 17 when she moved out of mom's house and purchased a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">five-bedroom, six-bedroom mansion</a> in Calabasas, CA for $2.7 million. Although mom helped her out with seizing the property, it was paid for 100 percent with Kylie's own money. And remember, this was before her billion-dollar <a href=#>makeup empire.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Kendall Jenner</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Older sister Kendall moved out around the same time and purchased a $1.39 million two-bedroom condo in L.A. when she was just 18. Like Kylie, she also paid for it herself with zero help from mom — er, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. Bella Thorne</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Unlike the Jenners, Bella Thorne's money wasn't inherited from her family. When she purchased a $2 million house in 2016, she paid for it entirely with her Instagram money. "Instagram is 100 percent a job to me," she said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue documentary</a>. "I started out at 18 with literally $200 in my bank account, and I bought this house literally a year and a half later. That's all from social media."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. Justin Bieber</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>When Justin rose to fame at the tender age of 15, it was only a matter of time before he used his hard-earned cash to splurge on a home. In 2012, when he was 18, he paid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6.5 million for a property</a> in a gated community in Calabasas, CA. Khloé Kardashian purchased it from him in 2014. He and wife Hailey Baldwin are currently<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> thinking of buying Demi Lovato's old house</a>. Is it just us, or is celebrity real estate so incestuous?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. Miley Cyrus</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Although she promised her parents she wouldn't move out until she was 20, in 2010, Miley dropped <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million on a house</a> in Toluca Lake, CA, when she was just 17. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom mansion was more than your typical starter home. After remodeling the outdated interior, she put the house back on the market in 2015 for double its value.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. Hilary Duff</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Using her Lizzy McGuire money, she bought a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">five-bedroom, six-bathroom home</a> in Toluca Lake, CA for $3 million when she was only 17. She sold the property in 2010 to purchase a new home with her then-husband, Mike Comrie.</p><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7. Nick Jonas</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>With the help of his brothers, Nick <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a $2 million mansion</a> in Texas. The sprawling 7,000 square-foot house had six bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms — so there was more than enough room for all three of them. Considering this all happened back in 2008, that would've made Nick only 16.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8. Jamie Lynn Spears</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>When Jamie Lynn Spears became pregnant at 16, she and her baby daddy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought a house in rural Mississippi</a> for a modest $250,000. However, she wasn't there for long. After splitting up with her boyfriend, she was back at her mom's house a year later.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9. Jaden Smith</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>When he was just 15, Jaden Smith did something most kids could only dream of — he moved out of his parents' place. "I remember this day specifically. It was probably one of the most&nbsp;heartbreaking moments of my life," his mom, actress Jada Pinkett-Smith, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed in a conversation</a> with Jaden for her podcast. "You told me straight up—you were like, 'Mom, I have to leave here to live my life.'"</p><p>Fortunately, Jaden didn't have to spend millions of dollars for his own pad. Instead, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moved into a $4 million mansion</a> that was already owned by his family. Although technically he's still not a homeowner, he is the youngest celeb on this list to live in a mansion all by himself.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">10. Chloe Grace Moretz</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The Kick Ass star purchased a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.4 million Spanish-style home </a>in Studio City, CA when she was just 19. The mansion, which boasts a gym, a pool, and a spa, is light years above the grubby apartments most people her age live in.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">11. Demi Lovato</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>For her 18th birthday in 2010, Demi treated her family to the ultimate present: a million-dollar mansion. "I just bought a house," Demi told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> at the time. "For me to give [that] to my family on my birthday, that was the best present." While her family lived in the main house, she stayed close by, living in a different abode on the mansion's property.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">12. Daniel Radcliffe</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Before he was old enough to drink in the U.S., Danielle Radcliffe owned property on U.S. soil. He purchased a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.8 million penthouse</a> in New York City in 2007 when he was 18. He later purchased two more NYC condos, all before 2009. Most of the properties were just for renting. His real home was a s<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ecret penthouse in Melbourne, Australia</a> that was purchased by his parents when he was 16. When he turned 18, the deed was transferred to him. So basically, before he turned 21, he had four properties under his belt. He definitely put all his Harry Potter money to good use.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcmZpaV9lhXC1wWmOhYRmZLCmuMSbqaKsqWLBprHNZp%2BopZWkxK%2Bx0aw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
