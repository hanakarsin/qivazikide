More drama, more babies, and (obviously) more rumors. Each of the moms on the show is dealing with all three of these things, but <a href=#><u>Kailyn Lowry</u></a> might have had one of the biggest bombs dropped on her in the first episode of Season 10.</p><p>While Kailyn was pregnant with her son Creed (her second child with <a href=#><u>Chris Lopez</u></a>), rumors started flying that Chris may have been expecting a baby with another woman at the same time. After a sneak peek of Kailyn discussing the rumor, people want to know: How many kids does Chris Lopez have? Here‚Äôs what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">How many kids does Chris Lopez have?</h2><p>It‚Äôs definitely tricky trying to suss out details of Chris‚Äô personal life because he prefers to remain pretty private. We totally get that ‚Äî being on a show like Teen Mom 2 certainly opens one up to all kinds of attention (which in turn often results in a lot of criticism). He‚Äôs typically blurred out from episodes of the show, and that‚Äôs only when he agrees to make ‚Äúappearances.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, we know for sure that Chris has at least two kids because he shares them with Kailyn. Kailyn gave birth to their son Lux Russell Lowry on Aug. 5, 2017. Creed Romello Lopez was born on July 30, 2020. Creed is Kailyn‚Äôs fourth child (and fourth son), and her second child with Chris.</p><p>In a sneak peek for Season 10 of the show, Kailyn revealed that while she was pregnant with Creed, rumors started to spread that Chris was also expecting a baby with someone else. In a clip of the show that was filmed before Creed‚Äôs birth, a Teen Mom 2 producer asks Kailyn to address the rumors. ‚ÄúI guess he said something on his Instagram Live ‚Äî he said something to insinuate there's a baby on the way," Kailyn said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry)</a> on Sep 23, 2019 at 8:00am PDT</p></figure><p>She then said that she had received a call from Chris and he had told her that if she heard a rumor saying he had gotten someone else pregnant, it wasn‚Äôt true. Kailyn decided to believe Chris but she admitted that her initial thought was that the rumors were true.</p><p>‚ÄúMy f----d up way of thinking was, OK, he's doing damage control and maybe he potentially has somebody else pregnant and he doesn't know, so he's telling me it's not true until he confirms,‚Äù she told the producer.</p><p>Then, Kailyn started receiving text messages from a ‚Äústrange number‚Äù from someone saying Chris needed to talk to them about the baby he had on the way. Kailyn immediately called Chris to demand answers, but he continued to deny the rumor. Kailyn was upset ‚Äî she says that‚Äôs mostly because she doesn‚Äôt want to keep any of Lux and Creed apart from any siblings they may have.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúI don't want my kids to grow up without their siblings like I did,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is so important to me. I'm going to cry.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>What to believe? üßê As rumors swirl about Chris getting someone else pregnant, @kaillowry questions the fate of their relationship on tonight‚Äôs #TeenMom2 season premiere.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Teen Mom</a> (@teenmom) on Sep 1, 2020 at 1:01pm PDT</p></figure><p>For now, there hasn‚Äôt been any official confirmation about whether Chris does indeed have another child with someone other than Kailyn.
