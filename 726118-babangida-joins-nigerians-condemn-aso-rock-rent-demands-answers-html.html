The Aso Rock food budget should be reviewed. Aso Rock is not a place to feed Politicians."</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Obasanjo, Babangida promoted corruption - Braithwaite</p><p>Buhari, who hammered so hard on the economic challenges facing the country following the sudden fall in crude oil prices, assured Nigerians that the budget would mitigate the effect of the unbelievable reality. The president also promised that the budget would cut waste from government spending while its funds would be directed to public good.</p><p>But, the recent breakdown of the budget, especially the allocations made to the Aso Rock villa, ignited furious reaction from Nigerians who took to a micro blogging site (Twitter) to inquire for answers that are still in the pipeline. Some described the budget as a collection of fraudulent and frivolous allocations aimed at sustaining the flamboyant lifestyle of public officials.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> IBB becomes grandfather again</p><p>The general renovation of Aso Rock guest house alone was proposed to cost N387,980,200, while furnishing the rooms in the guest house would gulp the sum of N45million.
