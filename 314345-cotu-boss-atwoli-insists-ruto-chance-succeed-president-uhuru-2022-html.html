You are going to elect the country's leader but that government will not have people like William Ruto, Boni Khalwale and the entire Tanga Tanga brigadeThe same will apply to all leaders who are opposed to the handshake and the Building Bridges Initiative. If they get lucky, then the closest they will get to governance will be in the opposition side ," Atwoli stated.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Activist Boniface Mwangi warns Kibra residents against electing McDonald Mariga to Parliament</p><p class=align-left>This salvo followed an earlier one where the COTU boss averred there will be a referendum before 2022 where citizens will elect a prime minister, a president and two deputies respectively.</p><p class=align-left>He, however, triggered mixed reactions when he claimed Ruto's name will not be on the ballot.</p><p class=align-left>Ruto and his lieutenants have been on the spot especially from Team Kieleweke and ODM leaders who claim the DP's camp is already campaigning hardly two years after the last presidential election.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/941a658354a38ca6.jpeg><p class=align-left>Among those who have taken a swipe at the DP for politicking is former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo but Ruto dispelled the claims before President Uhuru.</p>"Because Kabogo is equally your friend and mine too, he gets cheeky sometimes. He has now come to report me to you that I am involved in endless politics. I will, however, like to clear the air and tell you that the accusations are not true. If there are people involved in 2022 campaigns, then you can be sure I am not among them. That is not me. It is another clique of leaders," Ruto hit back at Kabogo on Saturday, August 24.<p class=align-left>The DP has also been a subject in a verbal bruising attack lodged by Raila allies against leaders opposed to the Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI).</p><p class=align-left>On Sunday, Ruto weighed in on the topic and rubbished surging calls for a referendum as a course aimed at creating plum government positions for five communities in the country.</p>Are we solving inclusion or are we entrenching and constitutionalising marginalisation and exclusion. We must be careful about what we do," the DP said.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
