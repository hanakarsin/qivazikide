It is something which is exemplary because I can't imagine such kind of project could be up with insufficient funds which just trickle down. The governor has managed within a short time to build a hospital almost bigger than the Russian one built by the Russian government which was one of the superpowers then," said Oburu.<p class=align-left>He lauded the county's chief executive Wycliffe Oparanya whom he said had worked and delivered much within his two terms making Kakamega meet the parameters requisite for city status.</p><p class=align-left>According to Oburu, the municipality under the watch of Oparanya has become organised, clean and developed making it a perfect co-equal of Mombasa, Nairobi, <a href=#>Kisumu</a> and now Nakuru.</p>"The way I have seen the county, it is more than ripe. There is sewerage, highrise buildings continue to come up, the town is being developed in an organised manner. Kakamega has made big strides making it ripe to be a city," he added.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1faf8f7bd7313750.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>India: 25 Million Locals Shut out Of Internet Access to Curb Cheating in Teacher Eligibility Exam</span></p></a><h2>Elevation of a municipality to a city</h2><p class=align-left>In Kenya, the request by a municipality to have it accorded the city status is handled by the Senate.</p><p class=align-left>In this case, an ad hoc committee constituted in the <a href=#>Kakamega County</a> Assembly addresses the request to the upper house.</p><p class=align-left>The Senate's Committee on Devolution then deliberates on the matter as it engages the relevant stakeholders including the governor as it assesses the state of the municipality and if it meets the standards of a city.</p><p class=align-left>After a series of deliberations, the committee tables before the floor of the Senate its recommendation which is debated upon.</p><p class=align-left>Should the recommendation pass in the Senate, its report is forwarded to the president for assent.</p><p class=align-left>Upon the president's approval, a charter is issued officially conferring the municipality in question the city status.</p><h2>Cities in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>The country has traditionally had Mombasa, Kisumu and Nairobi as the main cities until June 2021 when <a href=#>the Senate conferred Nakuru as the fourth city</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c85f1d12d0749e8a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kate Actress, Mother-In-Law’s Swapo and Alex Mwakideu to Star in New Film Nafsi</span></p></a><h2>Urban Areas and Cities Bill, 2017</h2><p class=align-left>According to the Urban Areas and Cities (Amendment) Bill of 2017, city status is accorded if the municipality holds at least 250,000 people, its ability to provide basic services water and sanitation, street lighting.</p><p class=align-left>Other parameters are proper drainage systems, an effective public transport system, health services, ambulance services, and public cemeteries.</p><p class=align-left>A municipality eyeing the status must also have a fire fighting and disaster management system in place.</p><p class=align-left>A city is also expected to have several recreational facilities, state of the art stadia facilities, good road networks, solid waste management systems, <a href=#>education</a> institutions that include pre- care facilities, training institutions, community centres, conference facilities and air transport facilities.</p><p class=align-left>Reliable sources of energy and electricity supply is also a factor considered before the city status is conferred.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkXBubWldpK%2B2vtRmpp2hnpyubrzRqKeoq5Woeqa4xK%2BYraGfo3qwsoykmKSZnZq0onnTqGScoaSuerTAwK2srGWZqcBusMSvnKWnoJqxbrvRoJinoaOasW%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
