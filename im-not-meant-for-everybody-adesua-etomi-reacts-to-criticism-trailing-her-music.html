Obviously there are people that appreciate the start of a new journey but I also understand that when people know you doing one thing, it’s kinda hard for them to open their minds to the fact that you’re trying to do something else.</p><p>But all these things take time and I am patient enough to win over anybody that needs convincing, and guess what? Not everybody is going to be convinced and that’s okay too. Everybody is not for everybody.”</p><p>Speaking about some Nollywood stars who delved into music and didn’t do well, <a href=# rel=noopener>Adesua Etomi</a> said fulfillment should be of uttermost importance instead of commercial success.</p><p>According to Adesua, her music is not meant for everybody as every singer has his/her unique sound and audience.</p><p>In her words: “What is the classification of not doing well? If you get fulfillment from something, just because it isn’t necessarily a commercial success doesn’t mean you didn’t do well. I know that my music probably won’t be for everybody but I’m also content with that.</p><p>“Everybody has their unique sound and their unique audiences and people that everybody loves, some people may not vibe to their music and that’s okay. You’re not meant for everybody and I know that I’m not meant for everybody. I don’t think there’s anybody in this whole world that is meant for everybody.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49qZqKlXaO8tXnMnpinrF2bvLN5xK%2Bcq7GSpLG6ecCdnKytkWKytbvMomSrnZGYwbR506hknKqZqbaktdKmZK2qkZ65qrrGZp%2Beql2iwrS1wmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
