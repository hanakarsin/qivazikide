On Jan. 6, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> that, although the couple has had their “ups and downs,” she and her family stepped up to support her ex.</p><p><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> wrote a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">touching tribute</a> to True and Khloé’s son’s other grandmother after the news broke and described her as the “most amazing, dedicated, devoted, and selfless mom and such a loving, kind, and fabulous grandmother.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@krisjenner</a></figure><p>Several weeks after Kris’s post, Khloé broke her silence about losing Andrea. The <a href=#>Hulu star</a> shared multiple pictures of her and Andrea or Tristan. Khloé also posted photos of herself and Andrea and said she had been “avoiding” having to talk about the tragedy.</p><p>​​”I have so much to say but nothing at all. I have so many emotions, and still, I feel numb,” Khloé wrote in her caption. “Life can be brutally unfair at times, and this has been one of the toughest times in so many of our lives. But at the same time, I feel blessed that I am lucky to have had someone that makes saying goodbye so incredibly difficult.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Khloé Kardashian (@khloekardashian)</a></p></figure><p>Khloé also shared that instead of saying goodbye to Andrea, she will accept that she has to “miss” her, though she believes they will see each other again. In the meantime, Khloé vowed to help all of Andrea’s sons, especially Amari.</p><p>“I know you never wanted to leave your boys,” she added. “They are your entire world. They will learn to live with the hole in their hearts because they are warriors just like their warrior mommy. Just know, I promise you, Amari will be perfectly OK. We will all look after him, help him and protect him. Your boys will be OK because they have their guardian Angel by their side.”</p><p>Tristan has yet to discuss his mother’s death publicly.
