Now, let’s see how this plays out in the morning. People leaving at 04:03am after 12 hours waiting for @wiakidayo. I feels so bad. I feel sad its happening in another country. Happening in Ghana.

Big Wiz no show up, the whole thing scatter.. mic, sound, light. Instead of Wizkid, we had Dj Tunez and Pocolee.”</p><p>OleleSalvador wrote: ”Wizkid’s set is originally set for 2-hours non-stop. Its 2:30 and he’s still yet to mount the stage. This means if he does mount the stage anyime between now and 3am, the show may end at 5am. The DJ is currently on rotation for close to 30mins. No Mc. No performance.”</p><p>Simply hephie called the promoters to refund the money taken from fans; ‘‘The organizers need to refund our monies because what is this?
