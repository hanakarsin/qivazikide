Following the live event in Washington, D.C., the influencers on the controversial app poked a little fun at the questions Shou endured.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Shou Zi Chew’s Congress testimony sparked many TikTok reactions.</h2><p>Multiple networks televised Shou Zi’s live testimony to Congress. As the testimony continued, TikTok users edited its clips for users to see. On March 23, one user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@_whittington</a>, shared several clips on his account, including a conversation between Shou Zi and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rep. Earl “Buddy” LeRoy Carter</a>.</p><p>Shou Zi and Buddy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> TikTok’s age dating system during their conversation. When the CEO shared that TikTok determines a user’s name by looking at their activity on their public profile. Buddy responded by saying the action was “creepy” after also accusing TikTok of scanning the users’ “eyes,” though Shou Zi denied TikTok ever collecting <a href=#>“body, face, or voice data.”</a></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@_whittington href=#>@_whittington</a><p><a title=tiktokban href=#>#tiktokban</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Whittington | Tech & Software" href=#>♬ original sound - Whittington | Tech & Software</a></figure><p>Mr. Carter’s explosive reaction to Shou Zi’s explanations caused an uproar of comments from TikTok users who felt the Georgia representative unfairly judged Shou Zi and TikTok. Others, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kaneeci</a> (Ceci), took to mocking Buddy through their own channels.</p><p>Ceci reacted to the testimony by mocking Buddy’s remarks at Shou Zi. The user pretended to be a more dramatic version of Buddy and Shou Zi in her video titled “Congress be like.”</p><p>“Well, isn’t it true that your app tracks people’s eyes to see if they’re dilated or not?” she asks in the video with a Southern accent, to which she, as Shou Zi, replies, “nooo.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kanececi href=#>@kanececi</a><p>They asked their assistants how to make a PDF just before the meeting started <a title=tiktokban href=#>#tiktokban</a> <a title=pov href=#>#pov</a> <a title=iwearmanyhats href=#>#iwearmanyhats</a> <a title=skit href=#>#skit</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Ceci" href=#>♬ original sound - Ceci</a></figure><p>While Ceci’s TikTok didn’t name Buddy directly, it didn’t take long for users to pinpoint who she was mocking in her video.</p><p>“This isn’t even a parody skit. This is legit how it happened,” one commenter said.</p><p>“I can’t wait for the <a href=#>South Park episode</a> about this,” another fan replied.</p><p>One commenter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@mjack94</a>, said Ceci’s parody only had one problem: “the CEO can finish sentences.” The commenter was referring to how Shou Zi struggled to give further details on the claims against him and TikTok. On multiple occasions, the members of Congress interrupted Shou’s responses to their questions about TikTok’s privacy settings, access to user data, and other topics.</p><p>TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@synsation_</a> reacted to Shou Zi’s treatments by mocking the Congress members’ cutthroat responses.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@synsation_ href=#>@synsation_</a><p>In case you have been missing the congressional hearing here is my impression of the current conversations going on in Congress about the Tiktok ban <a title=tiktokban href=#>#tiktokban</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Synsation" href=#>♬ original sound - Synsation</a></figure><p>While Shou Zi likely didn’t get to say everything he wanted in Congress, the 41-year-old businessman implemented a possible solution to guarding U.S. citizens’ personal information. He said TikTok’s US data-management initiative <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Texas</a>, is still in the works, though he neglected to share the current status of the initiative.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWwwYyzoGabmJrEbq%2FOp56rnaOoerW1yq2mpGWimq6kwMiopaw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
