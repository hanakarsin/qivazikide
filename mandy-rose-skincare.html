"It's all-natural products that have been in the works for a very long time... making sure that it's a high-end brand. It's a great product but also affordable where it's attainable for most people."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One look at Mandy's makeup-free face, and we're not surprised she wanted to share her skincare secrets with fans.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The collection will start with three items ‚Äî a boosting moisturizer, lifting serum, and a lifting eye gel ‚Äî before hopefully expanding. And Mandy is prepared to deal with the critics who don't think a wrestler should be releasing a skincare line.&nbsp;</p><p>"You're going to be faced with [criticism] regardless," she explained. "You just have to be ready and prepared for it." You can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shop the collection when it drops here.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Mandy also has a fitness app called "Fit With Mandy."&nbsp;</h2><p>If skincare is not your thing, you can work out just like the WWE diva thanks to her new iOS app, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fit With Mandy</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I love food, but I love working out, so it's just a balance," Mandy said of <a href=#>her love of donuts </a>and fitness. "I've been training and dieting for so long that I feel like I know my body really well... I train so hard a doughnut here or there isn't going to kill me."&nbsp;</p><p>It's that longtime passion for fitness that inspired her app, which is a 12-week at-home program designed for all levels and all ages. The program requires little to no equipment and Mandy describes it as a "high-intensity, interval-training workout."&nbsp;</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Mandy won the 2014 Bikini World Championship before competing on Tough Enough, the&nbsp;professional wrestling reality TV series, where she placed second.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Look for something positive in each day, even if some days you have to look a little harder. üôèüèªüíô - Wearing @vqfitwomen @vqfit (LINK IN BIO)</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Mandy Rose</a> (@mandysacs) on Jul 28, 2019 at 10:32am PDT</p></figure><p>As for her advice for people looking to get into shape or for anyone who needs a little help staying motivated, Mandy shared, "It takes time."</p><p>"You have to be consistent, that's a big part of it," Mandy continued.
