Thanks to @MBuhari, who scammed these bogies, Nigerians can’t be fooled by these old antiquated gimmicks and antics by @officialABAT handlers. Nigerians won’t be governed by photographs anymore”.</p><p>In another report earlier, the National Chairman of APC,<strong> Adamu Abdullahi</strong> warned that the party and its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, may lose the 2023 election without the support of governors.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the leadership of the APC, National Working Committee (NWC), members of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), and the leadership of the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) on Wednesday met over the controversial campaign council list.</p><p>Speaking to journalists, Abdullahi Adamu warned that the leadership of the APC must determine what was right and implement it as long as it is within the framework of INEC’s guidelines.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Adamu restated the need for the governors to support the party win the 2023 presidential poll.</p><p>He noted, “being the chief executive officers of their various states, the onus of our great party lies in the hands of God and in their hands because they are the commanders of the party fortunes in their various states.</p><p>“We cannot make meaningful progress in the affairs of these states, particularly in an election year that is approaching. We cannot plan without the buy-in of our governors so that we can stand together, believing that we share same aspirations.</p><p>“We will plan together to see how best we can deliver the interest of the party and ensure that victory is ours in 2023 general election that is by the corner. That is the essence of this meeting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49vZmtoYmh6r7XGnqmimZ6oeqStza1km51dmbKkscivnJ1lkq56sbTOraagqpGltbR50qiuqKqVYrmiuc%2BopqerXam2r8HBrqpmoJGjsa2x0axm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
