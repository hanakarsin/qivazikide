Here’s what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/Getty Images</span></figure><p>Now that he's officially divorced from Fergie, <a href=#>Josh Duhamel</a> has found himself a new girlfriend. The two have been dating roughly two years now and their relationship started in the midst of the finalization of Josh's divorce from the singer.&nbsp;</p><p>In his new relationship, sources have suggested that Josh is "really happy."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Josh Duhamel dating now?</h2><p>Josh Duhamel's girlfriend is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Audra Mar</a>i, a 27-year-old American model who was named Miss World America in 2016. The two of them were recently spotted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a> out on a date night in Malibu.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple was previously known to go out in public together regularly, often holding hands.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“They’ve known each other for quite some time and began dating seven or eight months ago,” a source speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People </a>said in February 2020. “He’s really happy with her.” Josh, who is 48, is 21 years older than Audra. They began officially dating after Josh and Fergie announced their split in 2017, but before their divorce was finalized in November of 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Audra Mari?</h2><p>In addition to being Josh's girlfriend and a wildly successful model, Audra also has a history worth exploring. She is originally from North Dakota and is of Filipino descent.&nbsp;</p><p>Her father moved to the U.S. from the Philippines in order to create a better life for his family, and Audra <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said </a>that his story was proof that anything is possible in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Audra Mari (@audramari)</a></p></figure><p>In addition to her immigrant roots, Audra was also bullied in school. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventeen</a> in 2011, she explained that she was made fun of because she was so tall and thin. The other girls in her class would apparently call her "sasquatch." Eventually, she told her parents what was going on.&nbsp;</p><p>“Finally, I told my mom, I told her everything that was happening. She talked to the administration, and they brought the girls in and talked to them about it,” she told the magazine. “You just have to bring it to the attention of people in a position of authority.” Even in 2011, Audra was already competing in pageant competitions and working as a model. She's also done modeling work for major corporations like H&M.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Josh and Fergie had a long relationship history.</h2><p>Fergie and Josh's relationship ended back in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>“With absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,” they said at the time. “To give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.”&nbsp;</p><p>The two were married for eight years, from 2009 to 2017, and share a son named Axel.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Before they got married, Josh and <a href=#>Fergie</a> began dating all the way back in 2004.&nbsp;</p><p>They were engaged in 2007 and married two years later. By Hollywood standards, that's a fairly long relationship. Now that they've parted ways, neither one seems to harbor any ill will toward the other. Instead, they're both living their separate lives, and Josh has entered a relationship that apparently makes him happy. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKOno516pcHHmqSepF2ZrrW1zaBkp6en</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
