I seek for justice, equity and fairness. For those who feel that Samuel Ortom is talking too much, I want to appeal to them, to give me justice, give our people justice, give our people fairness and ensure equity. I promise you that I will never say anything again.”</p><p>“Let me once again call on the APC led Federal Government to rise up and give leadership. Our people are in pains.</p><p>“From the North-East, North Central, North-West, South-South, South East and Southwest, everyone is faced with security challenges. Without security, there can be no meaningful development except in PDP controlled states.</p><p>“I want to challenge the APC in this country because they have failed. Economically, security wise, socially and politically, the APC government is in deficit.</p><p>“Government is all about providing security for lives and property. Government is about providing infrastructure like the one we are doing here today.</p><p>“Today, I am here in Oyo state, my brother (Makinde) was in Adamawa; a PDP controlled state earlier to commission project and lay foundation. Go to Rivers state, everyday what you see is laying of projects or commissioning of project, the same thing in Bauchi state, go to Sokoto and other PDP controlled states, you will see development. That is what leadership is and that is what the people of Nigeria are yarning for,” he said.</p><p>Governor Ortom also commended his Oyo State counterpart, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Seyi Makinde</a></strong> for doing so much for the people of the state, urging him not to relent.</p><p>“I commend my brother, that within the spate of two years, we are here to commission among others, a 65km of roads duly asphaltic with a guarantee of 20 years. I congratulate you my brother.</p><p>“And I believe and trust that he will do more for the people of the state. I commend Oyo people for giving him the backing and support.</p><p>“Don’t ever contemplate on leaving your people, work with them, do what they want, feel their pains, share their pains and also give them leadership that will lead them out of their pains,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, on Thursday, noted that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Nigeria is presently dripping in bitterness</a></strong> and sadness.</p><p>The elder statesman said even though the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, bad leadership has made it unachievable.</p><p>Obasanjo stated this in Abeokuta while unveiling a book authored by Femmy Carrena in his honour and titled “The Man, The General, The President”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49sZrCgqWK2bq3LsJiyq12Yv6rAyJygs51dpb%2Bmv8idnKesXZfCqa3RomSappRitaq%2FjJqbpqGensC1vsCtoKimXaS%2FtbvMaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
