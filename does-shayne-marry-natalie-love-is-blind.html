Ultimately, Shayne decides the woman he wants to propose to is Natalie. As a result, Shaina ends up temporarily moving on with Kyle.</p><p>Natalie is extremely excited to learn that Shayne wanted to choose her to settle down with over Shaina, but has that excitement lasted? One major question fans of this popular <a href=#>Netflix</a> reality TV show were asking before the finale was whether or not Shayne and Natalie are officially married.</p><p>And now that the finale dropped on Netflix, we have the answer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Shayne and Natalie from 'Love Is Blind' married?</h2><p>The Season 2 finale reveals that a major fight between Natalie and Shayne went down before their wedding. Still, they show up for their big day. But when they get to the altar, Natalie says she can't go through with it.</p><p>Afterward, Natalie and Shayne discuss their fight from the night before. Apparently, Shayne said he hated Natalie and that she was the worst thing for him.</p><p>It was an off-camera blowout the night before their wedding. And even though both Shayne and Natalie are at their wedding, they don't get married. And even if they are somehow together outside of the show, chances are, there are no wedding bells in their future.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Natalie Lee (@natalieminalee)</a></p></figure><p>A quick scroll through Natalie's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> doesn’t reveal any hints or indications that she’s still in a relationship with Shayne. A recent photo she posted shows her taking a mirror selfie without a visible diamond on her ring finger; however, it’s possible the photo is showing her right hand, in the case of photo mirroring.</p><p>Peeking at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shayne's Instagram</a> doesn’t provide any clues about a possible relationship with Natalie either. The Chicago realtor has been posting a lot of promotional content for Love Is Blind lately, but no pictures with Natalie. We know the couple doesn't get married, but they may not be friends anymore either.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@shaina.hurley</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What exactly happened in the love triangle between Shayne, Natalie, and Shaina?</h2><p>When Shayne first enters the pods, he develops romantic feelings for both Natalie and Shaina.

She says that Natalie and Shayne aren't right for each other, but Shayne is still loyal to his fiancé at this point.</p><p>Sadly, things don't work out for Shayne and Natalie on their wedding day, but you can't say they don't give it the old college try.</p><p>Love Is Blind is now streaming on Netflix, and the Season 2 reunion episode drops on March 4, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ysn5qxnpp6rq3Rq7BmppGprq21xGajqK6VYra0ecGloKec</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
