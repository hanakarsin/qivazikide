Though his father, J.D. Malone, was in the stands cheering him on and supporting him (alongside his three siblings), his mom was, unfortunately, absent.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Brody Malone's mom?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Brody's mother wasn't in the stands cheering him on during the Paris Olympics. In 2012, his mother, Tracy, passed away from cancer when he was just 12 years old. A quiet athlete, Brody doesn't talk much about his parents, so he hasn't disclosed to the public what his mother's diagnosis was, though based on some Instagram posts from 2013 that showcase a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pink ribbon</a>, it's likely his mother passed away from breast cancer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brody Malone also lost his step mother in 2019.</h2><p>After the loss of his mother, Brody's father eventually remarried a woman named Lynn Johnson. Unfortunately, she was not in Brody's life for very long; in 2019, she also passed away after suffering a brain aneurysm. At this time, there is no evidence of Lynn anywhere on Brody's Instagram page, so it's impossible to say if they were close. That said, the gymnast refuses to let these heavy moments stop him from continuing to live his life.</p><p>“It helped me realize no matter what happens in your life, you can always move on from it,” Brody told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in 2021 before the Tokyo Olympics. “Not in a way that you forget the past, but that you can always move on and do better. Life goes on whether you like it or not.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSbqp%2BZxm65wKWmp51doryu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
