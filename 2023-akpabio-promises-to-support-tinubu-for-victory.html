When I assessed the APC, I noticed that we needed peace and unity in the party and since the Northern Governors in their show of patriotism, have decided that power should come to the south, I had to give my support to one of the founding fathers of the party and a man with vision and mission, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</p><p>“I have just returned from the North with our Presidential candidate, Asiwaju Tinubu. From what I saw, he enjoys tremendous support from our northern brothers. He is accepted all over the country and from the political indices on the ground, he will emerge the next President.”</p><p>At the party’s campaign office in Ikot Ekpene Local Government, where the inauguration was held, Akpabio noted that “The people of Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District want to use this election to prove to the world that their son, Senator Godswill Akpabio, won the senatorial election in 2019 but the results were manipulated against him and one of those who took part in that heinous crime, is today cooling off in prison.</p><p>“The outcome of that election was taken to Uyo against what the law says and the rest is now history. Another opportunity now beckons for the good people of Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District to prove a point, that their votes were for me in 2019”, he stated.</p><p>“Let me also caution our supporters. Whoever brings money to you, collect it but vote your conscience because your vote will surely count this time around. Don’t swear to any fetish oath. Vote APC all the way. Don’t allow the ongoing court case challenging the candidacy of Obong Akan Udofia to deter you, he remains the candidate of the party.</p><p>“A vote for me to go to the Senate is a vote for appointments, human capital development, Scholarship and empowerment and taking Akwa Ibom to the centre of national politics.</p><p>“I will campaign in all the units, wards and local governments of the state. I will preach the message of hope because the Egyptians you see today, you shall see them again no more. They will lie against us, blackmail us and say whatever they want to say against us, but at the end of all that the will of God shall be done,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FxZmtoYmh6orfPmpmip12lv7C5yKycrGWkpHq0wc%2BppqusXam2r8HBrmSfp6Jiw6qv06ipsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
