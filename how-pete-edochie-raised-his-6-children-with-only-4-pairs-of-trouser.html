But he never cared. He hardly bought new things for himself. All he cared about was taking care of his family and giving his children the best. Then he was a civil servant before the movies came. There wasn’t much money but he would never take anything that doesn’t belong to him. Then if we come back from school with anyone’s pen or book, your nyash go catch fire for his hand. Amongst many other things, my parents taught us to be content with whatever we have, work hard, believe in God and be upright citizens. All he kept on saying was this ‘if I give my children the best training and the best education they will survive anywhere and they’ll never lack and I will be a fulfilled father’. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Now that I’m older, with each passing day I appreciate you and mum so much more. Thank you. Thank you Dad. Thank you Chief Pete Edochie @peteedochieThank You.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49tZqGnp2K9psDEZpydp5OdtqZ50ZqgrJ2UYrWqv4xvZJygmaGxs7HNZq6irJhivK%2B42GZrZqiRnr%2B0ec6fZK2qn6rApr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
