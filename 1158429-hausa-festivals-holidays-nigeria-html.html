It is a tradition since 1934. Back then, the celebration was organized to honor the visit of Sultan of Sokoto. At first, this festival wasn’t celebrated regularly. It used to be irregular gatherings of fishermen. However, today it is a big event, and it truly attracts tourists and Nigerians from different corners of the country and world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f19a51346b459a26.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Restructuring Nigeria’s overbloated academic curricular by Moshood Olajide (opinion)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another interesting cultural festival celebrated in Hausaland is called Kallon Kuwa Festival. It is an annual event for many local villages and towns. People enjoy this cultural holiday because it symbolizes the ending of the cropping season and gives them hope that ‘Kaka’ will arrive (this is a symbol of wealth for different spheres of life, from social to economical).</p><p class=align-left>Farmers love Kallon Kuwa festival because it means the time has come to rest and enjoy music and various entertaining activities. People enjoy some traditional sports such as dumb (this is how boxing is called in Hausa land) and koko (the local name for wrestling). They also sing and dance everywhere across their territories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f19a51346b459a26.jpeg><h3>Hausa Music Festival</h3><p class=align-left>Music is a big part of Hausa people’s life. Little Hausa kids start to learn dancing and playing musical instruments when they are young. The main topics of Hausa songs are praise of local historical people, historical events and prominent figures in Hausaland.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/858544a725e7a198.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bajaj is the most durable Keke, covers 5500kms on tough Nigerian road</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Musical performance is also an integral part of the culture. Hausa group plays folk music on a Goge or Goje (one-string fiddle), algaita (huge flute) and kakaki (trumpet). These musical instruments are used in the music festival of dances that include drummers, dancers and performers who do magic tricks in public. Drummers use special instruments. Dancers also wear leather and accessories. Such groups go from town to town to make the friendship between Hausa people stronger.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Hausa culture and traditions in Nigeria: top facts to know</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyts4m4tpfqapg.jpeg><h3>Islam: Names of Hausa Festivals</h3><p class=align-left>Most members of Hausa group are Muslims.

It lasts for 3 days, from morning to night.
