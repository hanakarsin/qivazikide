It was reported that there were 2 Nigerians and one Israeli on board.</p><p>In a further development <a href=#>the federal government&nbsp;allegedly provided documents</a> to prove that the money transported was meant for buying equipment for the military adding that the deal was lawfull and had nothing to do with arms smuggling. However <a href=#>the South African side&nbsp;was reportedly not satisfied with the explanation</a> saying that the manner&nbsp;of money import contravened the law of their country.</p><p>The saga continued yesterday when the major opposition party alleged&nbsp;Dokubo-Asari was involved in the deal and urged President Goodluck Jonathan to comment on&nbsp;what the former militant&nbsp;was doing on the plane, Punch reports.</p><p>In a statement released October 8 by APC&nbsp;National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the party insisted that the Nigerian authorities were to answer&nbsp;a lot of questions in connection with the issue.</p><p>According to them, the questions emerged because&nbsp;even the National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd.), who issued the end-user agreement for the purchase, "does not and cannot purchase arms for any of the armed services".</p><p><i>"Under our constitution, the NSA is an adviser and has no executive powers to deploy troops from any of the services or purchase arms for them. That the arms purported to be purchased from South Africa were ordered from the office of the NSA is nothing but a mere fabrication, and raises serious questions about the motive for the purchase.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Seized Cash: APC Blasts Jonathan</a></p><p><i>"Nigerians will therefore like to know on whose behalf Asari Dokubo was purchasing arms. This is very crucial because Asari Dokubo has been threatening that Nigeria will not know peace if his benefactor, President Jonathan, is not re-elected. Therefore, Nigerians will like to know whether he has started stockpiling arms to make his threat a reality, since elections are due in a few monthsâ€™ time."</i></p><p>According to the statement, "this man who once took arms against the state" might be plotting to harm the country.</p><p>Meanwhile the ex-militant when contacted was outraged by the APC's allegations. Speaking from Saudi Arabia <a href=#>where the official is currently&nbsp;performing the 2014 Hajj</a>, he said he had&nbsp;last&nbsp;visited&nbsp;South Africa 12 years ago and even theoretically could not be there, as he had no visa to enter the country.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>APC Reps Storm Out Of The House Over "$9.3m Jet" Issue</a></p><p><i>"Can you enter any country without a visa? No person can enter any country without a visa. Presently, I am in Saudi Arabia performing my Hajj as the Amirul Hajj of Bayelsa State and this can be confirmed. I flew Flynass from Kaduna on September 27. So, it is really a shame that Lai Mohammed who has defiled the name of Allah has become a pathological and award-winning liar.</i></p><p><i>"Nobody enters any country without a visa and I have not been to South Africa since 2002. I flew Arik airline from Lagos on the September 27 and went to Kaduna where I flew Flynass airline and came to Saudi Arabia."</i></p><p>As the discussions about&nbsp;the cash confiscation continues, <a href=#>another $5.7 million&nbsp;from Nigeria was seized in a similar development, again in South Africa</a>.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHF%2BlW5pZpmgmHqiuMuenp6rXZm8rMHBqGSaq5Gntm7DwKxkoqampLm3scNmoKdlaWKArnnDnpilZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
